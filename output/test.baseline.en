they came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , rough , homeless , the on a violin and playing , who are only two strings , had .
many of you are the story know , because of <unk> article about it was later a book , that produces <unk> was , robert <unk> junior varsity when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , which <unk> , the most <unk> studied and by promising career , sadly , early by paranoid schizophrenia , ending up .

i recommend you all , <unk> book to read or at the film started to do n't just the wonderful about interconnection and understand that between those two men that is , but , like the music that connection that helped and how they finally this instrument was , if the the pun and allows is that <unk> , nathaniel away from the road to get .
i met this mr <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , the , walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a demo of <unk> first , and <unk> symphony of yours and i got behind the stage , as to me introduce you .
he talked in a very <unk> and <unk> sound over the yo-yo ma , hillary clinton , and how to the dodgers abandoned it never in baseball world series of creating what would and this because of <unk> passage of the first violin at the last sentence by <unk> <unk> symphony .
we came to the countryside , sort of music to talk . and a few days later , i got an email , the state that nathaniel looking for <unk> me interested .
i have n't mention that nathaniel a medical <unk> , because he was already with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> been treated , a trauma , that puts his life to follow it .

and just a <unk> ended up nathaniel , when we do with our first to class in the , walt disney <unk> hall , started . he 'd like misdirection flickering in his eyes and it seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible , demons and smoke and about how would anyone in my sleep and poison and i wanted .
i was afraid , not donated , but i was afraid that i saw him lose your way that he was in one of his states , sinking could , and that i made its relationship with a violin at destroying the fact , when i started , about <unk> and <unk> and other really exciting forms of <unk> <unk> to talk .
i started so easy to play .
i played the first sentence by <unk> <unk> .

it was , as though he under the impact of an invisible <unk> level , a chemical response , whose catalyst -- my game was .
<unk> <unk> rage and turning to understanding , a calm and exploration and <unk> .
and the way through a miracle that he took his violin and started , deaf , some excerpts from <unk> to play and then lighting myself , you to end to play : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started coming up , about music to talk , starting from the stream in a beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , of <unk> down to <unk> <unk> .
and realized that he 's not just a <unk> know about music is owned , but it with you have a close your personal relationship connected .
he spoke of her with a passion and a deeper understanding that anything else i just by my colleagues in the philharmonic , from los angeles to know .
by the music playing and about music playing , from this <unk> , confused a man of you 're running around the streets of los angeles , dragged me was , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> musicians have become .
music is medicine . music is transforming ourselves .
for nathaniel means that music <unk> health .
because the music , it allows him , his thoughts and intractable delusions and with his imagination and creativity in something <unk> <unk> .

i understood that exactly this creature of art is .
now this is the reason that we music making this to something , that all of us , deep inside out , our feelings , by our artistic lens , through our creativity to the fact , they can .
and the fact that expression -- reaching us all , and moves , one , and it unites us .
what nathaniel <unk> , took him the music back in a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music took him back in a family of musicians , who would be understood the be a talent and realized , and it <unk> .

thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you , thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i 'd like play , that i <unk> the <unk> stolen from college .
i hope , they excuse me .
so i have in my life , many fishes were known .
i only two very popular .

it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good <unk> , <unk> , a best-selling book on the menu .
what for a fish .
even better , he was in <unk> after the supposedly , the highest building standards of sustainability of selectively .
you could be so we 're dealing with you feel to him to sell it .
i had to this beauty of relationship to several months .

`` course , '' , i said .
here was a company , the to solve was trying to put something unimaginable human problem for us chefs , so it is how to keep that we fish on our menus ?
in the last 50 years , we have the ocean <unk> how we forests <unk> beat them .
it 's hard , the destruction , <unk> .
ninety percent of big fish , of that we love , the most abundant , the <unk> , the <unk> , this swordfish , they have collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more coming .
so it will probably disney or bad <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future would be .
many of arguments against . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , we take these tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds <unk> are necessary , lest you a pound <unk> get .
not very sustainable .
they’re not very good .
so here was finally one company , who tried it right to do .
i did they supported them .
a day before the event , i rang in the head of <unk> for the company in .
we call him , don .
`` clear don '' i said , `` just about the aggregate them right to have , you 're fabulously famous for , far out in the flood , that their environment , which is n't really polluted .
`` that 's true . '' , he said . `` we are so far out that the waste of our fish are handed down , not focused .

these <unk> of <unk> to 1 , '' , he said .
`` the best in the industry .
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one , what which feeds on her ?
`` sustainable energy protein , '' , he said .
`` great '' , i said . he put on .
and at that evening , i was in bed , i thought : the hell 's a sustainable protein that ?
so i rang , the next day , just before the event , don on .
i said , don , for instance , sustainable and proteins that ?
he said , he <unk> that 's not he 'll ask folks .
now i <unk> with a couple of people of the company . nobody could tell me a <unk> answer to give up until i finally , <unk> biologists <unk> .
we call him , also , don .
`` clear don '' i said , `` for instance , sustainable and proteins that ?
now he mentioned , some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i <unk> ?
he said yes , feathers of skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and to get food processes .
i said , `` how much percent <unk> consume it 's chicken ? ,
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
`` well that are about 30 percent . '' , he said .
i said , don , is very strongly remember , chicken at the fish to feed ?

i <unk> me from this fish .
no , not because i 'm a <unk> <unk> and <unk> am .
that i 'm actually .


it 's the romantic sort of the way , the you , ever better put his fish about being used to the fish even stronger loves .
i told him began to a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
a <unk> journalist , had been thinking of this fish will be .
you think that has kind of the <unk> .
he came on the table with a bright nights , <unk> white color .
the chef who had him <unk> .
be twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can a fish right off the taste of the time , after he <unk> was ?
i ca n't it , but this guy can it .
we call him miguel sokoloff . actually means he says jose miguel sokoloff .
and no , he has the fish do n't cooked , and he 's not a chef . at least on the kind of them and i travel underneath the idea .
he 's a biologist , <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner <unk> .
she is near the <unk> the river , <unk> .
to the 1980s , was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they <unk> <unk> on , basically the wetlands have been .
they took this by looking at this country <unk> .

now , they could n't do that it was working very , not economic .
and ecologically and it was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of birds in order , for this place , many oiled birds are .
and so , 1982 , a spanish company with green this country has bought .
what they 've done ?
they have the river in the drive around .
they 've literally the lever <unk> .
instead of this water <unk> used them the channels to regrow that water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a 11,000 components of acres <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , the shrimp , eel that -- and you have miguel , and his company in the environmental destruction , completely around .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they 've been seen before .
you stare out on the horizon , of a million miles away is , and everything you see are <unk> channels and this blood density , lush march .
i was there was n't long time with miguel sokoloff .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part `` a crocodile , kissing . ''

here , picks up with a rare <unk> came .
well before he the <unk> of phytoplankton .

it turns out that is miguel the most of his career in <unk> national park in africa has spent .
i asked him , like him to be a <unk> 's gone .
he said to fish ? i know anything about the fish .
i 'm an expert , relationships .
and then he leaves and fall , they are more <unk> of those rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and do n't let me wrong , this was really fascinating , you know the <unk> community <unk> , in the way .
it 's great , but i was n't fall .
and my head was weak about this <unk> piece of delicious <unk> , that i went around the brink of her .
so i 'd have broken . i miguel , how come up that your fish right off the taste ?
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , kid who are algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , this is incredible .
but we eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ?
now he goes on me to tell that 's such a <unk> system is that the fishes better food , you in the wild eat anything .

that is healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
it 's no food .
it away from a farm heard that they are not apple feeds ?
later on the day i went on this site , is miguel around and i asked him , i said , for a place , the kind of course it seems to be '' , unlike any rural farm , the i ever been , `` how it measures , you are succeeding ?
in the moment that was it as if a <unk> a <unk> to have been .

`` that 's success , '' , he said .
`` look sing their bellies on , pink .
they <unk> .
<unk> ? i was totally get confused .
i miguel , <unk> do n't find your fish ?
yes , he said .
`` we 're lost 20 percent of our fish and <unk> at the birds .
now the last year on this site 600,000 , birds , as 250 different species .
it 's now that 's largest and one of the key to private <unk> across europe has gone .
i miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not that last thing that is on a <unk> have want ?
he kept shaking his head , no .
he said , how we build <unk> on , not hard .
this is a <unk> network .
the flamingos , and eat the shrimp .
the shrimp , and eat the phytoplankton .
it , pinker 's so the stomach , the better that .

a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and the way we should those flamingos covered by <unk> not be there .
they breed in a city 240 million miles away , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning to fly up 240 feet deep for a farm .
and every night around and they 240 feet deep back .
they do this , because they of <unk> white line of a highway <unk> may follow .
i mean , .
i 'd kind of the journey of penguins had imagined , watched , i miguel , places .
i miguel , fly up 240 million miles to the farm and fly them up 240 feet deep back at night ?
they do this , for children ?
he looked at me , as if i just a song from the whitney , and houston , quotes .
he said , `` no . they do this , because food that 's better .
i do n't have the skin of my beloved fish mentioned , the most delicious was , and i ca n't <unk> . i do n't <unk> . i do n't <unk> .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i cook for almost never get

she liked the sweet and pure , as if you a half bites by the ocean , dignity .

he said , `` the skin , acts like a swam .
she 's the last <unk> , until something in the body to entry .
she has evolved over the evolutionary adaptation evolved to <unk> <unk> .



it 's a river , of those things to it leads , by those rivers , now tend to do to lead , chemical pollutants , drain of <unk> .
and if it down through that e : it and this leaves this is the waters clean , how it <unk> is .
that is healthy , it cleans that water .

because if that water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .

you might argue that she 's a recipe is for the future of good food if we 've been <unk> or <unk> talk .
what we now we need , is a radical new concept of agriculture from one , the food can actually good taste .
but for many people like this is a little too radical .
we 're not <unk> , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love this little <unk> . we talk about regional food . we eat organic .
and if they claim that the things are , the future of good food can assure you know somebody somewhere on and says , `` hey guys , i love the pink flamingos , but how they will feed the world ?
how they will feed the world ?
not allowed me to be honest ?
i like this question is not .
no , not because we have enough of calories are producing to the world more than just to feed .
one billion people will be <unk> .
one billion -- this is more than before -- because <unk> inequalities that in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now i like this question is not because they the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years we 're wired up .
grows grain down <unk> , <unk> at <unk> , chemicals at the earth 's chicken at the fish , and all the time has the big agribusiness , just wondered if we are more people 's cheaper to feed , how awful can that already be ?
this was the motivation . it was the <unk> . it was the plan that the american agriculture .
we should they call , she is , a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> , this quickly <unk> capital <unk> , that 's exactly this production has enabled .
this is not <unk> , and it is n't agriculture .
our <unk> today is a threatened , not based <unk> <unk> , because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through a fertile one country , not by the pumps , but through fresh water , not by the chainsaws , but through the forests , and not across boats , and nets , but through the fish in the oceans .
they want to feed the world ?
let 's just start with the question how we 'll tell ourselves to feed ?
or better do we need to the conditions do that every community to enable , herself to feed ?
so to do this , look not on this <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and ever-faster machines to stand there <unk> and it has never be quite good for food produced .
we 're going to look , instead , that environmental role model on .
this is that the two billion years <unk> <unk> .
look at jose miguel , places , farmers like miguel ,

because they are ones that 's also hired experts who fancy are .
and when i really honestly , i am , they 're a better , chef , did it ever be going .
you know that 's my right , because if that the future of good food is , which they are delicious be .
thank you .
if i give you today one thing <unk> want it is that the <unk> of data that we consume that 's bigger than the sum of bits and instead of looking at <unk> to think i want to thank you think about how we 're much information can use that comes to patterns are emerging and we kind of trends that recognizes that otherwise , not visible , has gone .
so , we see here 's a typical <unk> after the age , arranged .
this program that i do this nonsense , is a little experiment .
it means <unk> , and i do <unk> can do is that i went from a particular one cause filter it can , we say the accidents .
and instantly i see a different patterns that they 're shipping .
and it , because in <unk> here the people a <unk> are and she sits over the <unk> are .
we can one more step out and <unk> the data and then to innovate and see that <unk> and cancer in the usual suspects out there are , but not for everyone .
if we now further and after the age <unk> , we say , 40 years or a younger , we see that accidents , even the leading cause is about the at the people worry about .
and who <unk> see that 's this particular , men 's true .
you see so that they 're all of information and the data that way to start swimming in a <unk> <unk> pear .
and if we do for raw data can do , why not providing content matters ?
what do we have here are the front covers , every single , `` the sport <unk> '' which has ever in print .
it 's all right here . it 's everything online .
you can be like , after my talk , in their rooms and test .
with <unk> you can jump into a decade .
you can jump into a particular year .
you can go directly to a certain edition of jumping .
if i 'm here i look , i see the athlete that in this copy of stuff , and the sports .

now , when i just a <unk> tour of give you want to be so i think , `` ok , when i do anything with the subject i 'm cycling suggest that ?
so i walk a step back and <unk> of view .
now i 'll know , greg <unk> .

you do something that actually a little bit different is .
it 's something between , and we think it 's changing the way , and the way information can be used .
i 'd like this idea now a little more to carry with about what a little bit crazy is .
what we give you 've done is , we have every single <unk> taken and you on a little summary , reduced .

and i 'm just the kinds of the 500 of the most popular <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view , we can get lots of things .
now we get a sense across the themes that looked at wikipedia , most popular imagery .
i 'm going to do this topic <unk> ' `` vote .
now , after i <unk> ' `` elected , did n't know , i realized that the <unk> , who most likely to match time <unk> `` people of the year , '' are .
this is really important , there is an insight is that are not in a single <unk> out .
this is just to see if you step , population and this completely foreign policy .
<unk> on a certain way of the <unk> i can put in the topic that time <unk> `` people of the year , '' inside , go , and all together to see .
if i 'm all these people consider know , i realized that the majority of <unk> these are some people come from the science . some , even less , come from the economy . here 's my head . and one is coming from <unk> .
and interestingly , is a bono 's also a ted prize winner .
so we can actually dive and one look at all the ted prize winner and throw away .
you see , we 're surfing the web that first time as if it also really a net is , not just by side to side , but as much more abstractly .
and i 'd like that i 'd show what a little surprise to be .
we 'll take this is just the new york times website .
<unk> , this app -- i want it 's not a browser , call it ; it 's really any browser , but can websites to look -- and we bring these <unk> to each blog how this .
so i can step back , and directly to a specific <unk> jump .
this is why is important because only through this map of websites , in these kinds of and the way , the whole <unk> on the same type and the way you can .


and i can sort everything , today , i have looked at college , again <unk> .
and , when i had a step <unk> and at all look , i can put some new to organize an hour after my <unk> . here , i went <unk> ' and researching , here to `` bing , right here to live on the labs <unk> .

it 's a metaphor , who keep being used to , and every time it makes this picture of larger than the sum of throughout .
in the moment , this world , we think that data a curse those are .
we talk from curse at the <unk> .
we talk from `` drowning in the information . ''
what to talk about this situation to turn up and blogs that the head to ask , that we throw away from an end up to go to start by many things too many things go to do , and by this pattern , what otherwise , like remained largely doing ?
if we do it can , he 'll get <unk> <unk> , maybe a new source assistance of information .
and , rather than just only have access to move , can we know what they get .
and if we know that experience , then we can possibly even <unk> now .
then i hear on , thank you .

in my school got off with the bus to school , every day an hour route .
and my nose , stuck with me in a book , a <unk> , that my mind , other worlds <unk> and on <unk> way that mean to me <unk> , voracious , curiosity <unk> .
these curiosity killed himself has to this is that i always , when i 'm not in the school was , through the forests <unk> , i wandered , `` the sampling effort '' started collecting , frogs and snakes and bugs , and <unk> , all of bringing it home and under the microscope looked at .
i was totally <unk> , you know .


jacques cousteau came to our living with his him a tv show of us animals and places and a world full of wonders they showed that we have never had never would have imagined .
this has probably will just fine to capable of <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's neither the video games are these <unk> with computer-generated performance of movies are all the imagery in the media landscape was , i needed to the images in my head to create .
that we had looked at all . if we as children 's a book to read , we took the description of the author and projected that you look at the screen in our heads .
my response was that sketching and paint by aliens , alien worlds , robotics , <unk> and all so what .
in class , i was walking around the teachers get it , like me , <unk> textbook was hidden , <unk> .
the creativity had to be a way out .
and when he was done something interesting . what i 'm going to jacques <unk> programs is fascinated , the idea of a life completely unknown , the world here on our planet itself .
certainly would i 'll never an alien world with a one-person spaceship ever achieved . this seemed ominous and unlikely .
but here was a world that i actually enter it could , here on the earth , and she was like this fascinating and so exotic as all this , i 'd always imagined was , when i these books had read .
so i decided when i was 15 , <unk> to be .
that the only problem with them was that i in a tiny village in canada , living , 1,000 kilometers from the next ocean away .
it was sent me to do n't <unk> .
i <unk> my father , until he finally one <unk> in <unk> , to detect what i did , exactly the other side of border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the middle of winter , in <unk> , .
the ocean , but , with a real conservation , i received only two years later to face , when we went to california has moved .
since , the 40 years , the meantime <unk> are , i talked about 3,000 hours on underwater spent . 300 hours , it <unk> .
and i 've learned that the world of the deep , even the <unk> oceans , rich in <unk> life is , how we let 's really scarcely imagine .
the imagination of nature knows no borders , actually contrary to our own , <unk> human imagination .


when i realized then as an adult a profession <unk> , it that <unk> .
this seemed to the way , my inner drive , stories , you know , with my desire , images to create , to unite .
as a child , drew me constantly comic books , and .
so they were the movies of the way , and stories <unk> . that fit together .
of course , was the stories that i 'd <unk> , from the science fiction not terminator , '' , `` aliens , '' , and `` <unk> ''
so , `` <unk> '' i became my preference for the <unk> and this emerging with the <unk> connect .
so intertwined with being sort of my two passions .
something interesting happened , `` <unk> '' a <unk> problem in this film to solve -- and what they do we had some sort of liquid <unk> create -- that cracked , we on a computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
what 's just came out , the first a computer-generated <unk> , who ever in a film to see it was .
of bringing in which is no money one , specifically up after he just do n't attack caused a , but i noticed something fascinating thing that audiences around the world was like it was mesmerized by the magic , of it <unk> .
according to arthur clarke 's law are we know <unk> technology and magic , i wo n't rush to discriminate .
they saw so something magic .
and that i would freak exciting .
and i said , `` wow , that have necessarily in <unk> be involved .
so we went into `` the terminator or two guys , my next movie , even more on .
together with <unk> behold , we 're the guy from liquid metal . success of hanging out of them down like this effect there would .
and it worked . again , we had something magic is created . and the effect in the audience was the same . however , we have to the film is a bit more money <unk> .
by these two experiences and based , a whole new world 's come to a whole new world of creativity , <unk> .
so i founded a company , along with my good friend with stan winston studio , the way in the time of the best <unk> and <unk> was . she was called `` the digital <unk> ''

that we did , and <unk> let 's a while a competitive .
but the middle of the 1990s when we realized we came out that we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company , actually formed had -- to slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` computational avatar , '' written out that the <unk> in sort of visual effects and <unk> effects in the whole new heights , push myself , using realistic human , expressive characters , who are using <unk> produced yet been . and the <unk> should all <unk> his and the world ought <unk> be .
but the <unk> <unk> quite back . and people in my company that told me that we <unk> n't even in the position of that to create .
so , shifted that i believe that and made another movie about this big ship , that rose .
the <unk> i have this as `` romeo and juliet on a ship , '' which sells . it was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a passionate about film .
secretly , but i wanted to actually provide real wreckage of the titanic to immerse ourselves .
why i have the movie .
that 's the truth . that studio , i knew that 's not .
i they 're convinced , i said to dive to the wreckage . to film that the real , the wreckage .
we 're one of <unk> the movie show .
this is hugely important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing .
and i <unk> them , an expedition to fund .
crazy . but that goes back to go back , that your own imagination a reality rendering it can .
we then created in fact , six months after a reality , of me in a russian <unk> <unk> , four kilometers of the surface , the atlantic , and i from the real titanic , through a <unk> <unk> .
this was not a film , not definition , that was real .
so , that really got just blew .
and the preparation , were enormous . we had to give cameras and a spotlight , and all kinds of building .
and i fell on , how much of these <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you ascend back in that cramped capsule , then we 're levitated up into this dark , hostile environment , down , where no hope on the rescue device made , if you put it 's not even back a penny .
and i said , `` wow this is equally , as if i 'm going to a <unk> .
this is really cool .
i was really obsessed by studying the deep ocean .
anyway by the part of with curiosity and science to do it . it was everything it was exploring , it was a curiosity . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience who were going to hollywood would n't give away .
because , you know , i was able to me a creature , imagine , for that we get a visual effect of the design done . but i could n't tell me that we can imagine , i outside the window would see .
at some of the following expeditions i 'll be in <unk> seen , and sometimes these things that i 've never seen before i had seen , sometimes even things that do n't yet seen before i had , and for that science starting point , when we they saw , did n't have found .
that i 've been so right <unk> , and i wanted more .
and so i met up a slightly unusual decision .
after the success from the titanic '' i told me , `` okay , i mean <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood gathered on ice on top and i 'm going for a while <unk> .


we took a little robots that we built up , the a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and that down the inside of the ship can look , we 've ever done had been hurt .
nobody had ever that the inside <unk> exploring . you 'd still no cure for it . we evolved the necessary technology .
well , and there for me sit on the deck of titanic , a <unk> , and see <unk> of these <unk> this kind of a lot alike , which i know that once who performed there has .
and i fly with a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i 'm going shopping it doesn’t work well , but my mind is within the <unk> .


this is set up , which is an exact replica of <unk> the ship .
this was a highly strange and experience .
they made me this <unk> that you have such <unk> avatars and use , and that own consciousness in this vehicle , these different shape of existence , you can .
it was really weird freak profound
and you may have a brief act on this , maybe in a few decades , could happen , if you <unk> has to explore , or other things to do in all sorts <unk> <unk> that i 'd better than <unk> can imagine .
these sort of expeditions we started this , we actually had seen , really appreciate to learn , for example , these <unk> , where we these incredible <unk> animals ' rebel . that are sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live with some sort of chemosynthesis .
they are not in the sunlight <unk> system , how we do that .
and so you see animals , the right next one of 300 degrees hot that they survive there can .
the same time for how i also very much for <unk> , that was back of <unk> from my childhood .

this was fascinating .
but the end of running it 's going beyond that i <unk> with us in the deep took .
i took them , and <unk> you access to the world , and actually : <unk> , <unk> people who are those extreme situations care . i took them to the sources , that they look around , samples , and instruments , how could and forth .

so this out of the circle anywhere from my existence as <unk> , then as a kid , and the execution in reality .
over these <unk> i have a lot of learning .
i have a lot about science lessons . but i 'm thinking , you probably , a director , there have can lead to a leader be like a <unk> or merit .
i understood , but not a lot of leadership , before i this research expeditions <unk> .
because a particular point , i had to tell me , `` i do it actually here ?
why i do that what comes out ?
these stinking movies migrate to have no money one .
we play time now that caused a . of fame -- not a lane .
no matter , i thought about , `` titanic '' and `` computational avatar , '' <unk> and give me out of nails it on a towel that beach <unk> .
i 've all these films , these documentaries , for a very audience .
not a fame , not honor , no money . what you doing that ?
you 're doing it around the task will to the challenge will -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment that there . you 're doing it 's the <unk> because , and because of funny connection , the result , if a small group of people have a team , forming .
because we have this with only 10 to 12 people made , the years <unk> have partnered with . sometimes we were two to three months row on the lake .
and this community who you that the most important thing the warning score is , who are faced with each one , because a task <unk> has , who any other things can explain .


well , i went back to my next movie `` computational avatar , '' to spin , i tried the same <unk> apply it , which is that his team have respected and out in return , showing respect , deserves .
by this was the dynamics really changed .

hugely exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were for a period of a half years to a real family .
by changing at my kind of films to do , completely .
there are people , who were like , we have these <unk> 'm really good <unk> and the planet pandora , transport .
for me it was more a <unk> kind of my job to do the actual process , of yourself in the result has changed .
what can we are all the finish ?
those lessons we 've learned ?
i think at first piece of curiosity .
it 's the most powerful of human feature .
our imagination is a force that even a reality rendering it can .
and the warning of your team is more than all <unk> this world .
come to me fellow filmmakers , the but they give me one of advice , as i do you .
and i say <unk> you do n't even a .
this <unk> to others for thee . do n't it will be centered on to bet you do n't averse to itself . but to take risks on your enemy .
the nasa 's a <unk> failure is not an alternative .
but in the arts and when i study has to fail as an alternative to be , because there , guarantees that 's a leap .
no significant endeavor , this innovation is demanding , ever been done without risk that addressed .
you must be willing to make those risks on to take .
that 's the idea , the i 'm going to talk on the way to i want to fail , certainly is an alternative , fear but it 's no thank you .
today i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and this surprised , maybe something , because at my <unk> at the foundation , mostly around the vaccines , and seed and twirl , around the things that we self-invent , and deliver need to the poorest two billion a better life to enable .
but energy and varied climates are extremely important for those people , just took even more than for each other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> over many years that will grow . it 's have a weight or a crop . things that you can change , how it their fragile environment is not the endurance can .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to the uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , which is a climate terrible for you .
moreover , is the <unk> for you very important .
the fact is , , if you get away from one thing to the price down so we could , for <unk> more energy , far beyond most effective .
now the <unk> is about the time , like .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .

we are still gave us in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but to talk about the price down -- let us to the price to cut -- we 're hitting on a new green barrier , and this barrier on with carbon locked together .
co2 , warmed the planet and the equation for carbon is actually quite clear .
they <unk> that <unk> co2 , which has <unk> leads , and these <unk> has some very negative effects . effects on this weather and maybe even worse , of indirect result , that the natural ecosystems on such <unk> changes do n't customize to , and therefore the whole systems <unk> .
now the exact same relationship of a <unk> and of having the net <unk> and where those unexpected consequences are , there is some <unk> , but not a lot .
and there are certainly <unk> about how bad things the consequences will . but they become extremely bad be a man .
i have the <unk> multiple research , we need to really shut down near zero , right ?
not enough that half or a quarter ?
the answer is until we 're near zero to come up the temperature drops down into space .
so it 's a huge challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a half feet high office truck , of all under a consortium 3 feet a bridge , domestic needs . the you can then sort of skin care <unk> .
this must walk down , towards zero .
now we emit a year in a lot <unk> out , beyond 26 billion tons .
anybody guess what about 20 tons . kind of the poorest countries , less than one .
the average , there are about five million tons for everyone around the planet .
and somehow we need to change , fulfilling this , the that at zero to lower .
it 's been made constant temperature has gone .
just different economic transformations which have it really influenced and we need of <unk> rise to a reduction go and a reduction way to zero .
that equation , has four factors . a little <unk> . they have this thing left -- carbon dioxide -- that they 're moving towards zero want to bring and that by the number of people depend on , of the service , the person has the average use , the average of energy for any service and the co2 , that per unit <unk> will .
let 's just so every single factor of individually and look around and think we to fit this at zero to get .
probably have one of these numbers very close to zero .
now this is the basic algebra , but we go about it went through .
first we have the population .
today life was 6.8 billion people ,
and it <unk> at 9 billion to . at 9 billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we might be understood this is about 10 percent to 15 percent down , but it 's currently we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second is a factor for the services , which we use .
that includes all the food that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
that are very good things and <unk> means those services , almost every on the planet earth accessible to do .
it 's amazing that number drops .
in the rich world , the top of a billion , we could possibly <unk> make and less electricity , but the average will this number of every year go up and turned into interactions altogether more than double , the number of services , the per person to be provided .
we can see a very basic services . there 's home , light gauge , you the homework can read it ?
and these students have it , they go out and read them of schoolwork under the <unk> .
now to measure effectiveness , the e , the energy per service , then finally got news .
we have something that 's not going up ,
because of different successes in <unk> , through the other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> there are a lot of services , whose <unk> some of one of services , you can get 90 percent of water footprint .
in other vital service , like the production of <unk> , at 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , is the <unk> for improvement is very much smaller .
overall , if we optimistic that are , we get maybe a representation on a factor of three or maybe even a factor of six .
but at the first three factors , we 're now of 26 billion , maybe <unk> 13 billion tons ; i went . and that does n't come from a man .
so let 's take a look at the fourth factor at -- and this becomes a x-factor too -- this is the amount of co2 , the per unit <unk> will .
it turns out the question , if you that at zero to get .
if you coal , burning : no .
if you natural gas will burn : no .
nearly every <unk> for electricity <unk> today , co2 , except that renewables , and <unk> .
so , we were on a global level to have to do , is , a new paradigm to create .
we need <unk> .
now if i the term `` wonders , '' feature , i 'm not that 's impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
that internet and whose human services is a miracle .
the people here have to the development of many of this miracle that contributed .
normally do n't there <unk> that you a miracle that is a certain parts of date , needs .
normally do you basically just mark and there are coming in other not .
in this case , we need , but <unk> , and give a miracle in very short order to get .
now i wondered , how can i really that <unk> ?

i think back at last year , when i mosquitos to me and somehow i liked the people that .
the idea was for you really accessible , you know that 's people there , the to mosquitos to live .
for energy , i noticed this one .
i decided that <unk> of fireflies make my <unk> contribution to the environment , here would be .
so here are a couple of natural or fireflies .
it forced me <unk> that they do n't bite . actually going to do n't have time that glass , left .
now there 's all kinds of <unk> like this , but they bring all not much .
we need technological solutions , either one or obsessed with the one of unimaginable extremes of scale and almost unimaginable <unk> have and although it many different directions well , where people wo n't search , i see it really only five of these large demands can afford .
i tides , <unk> , the merger and use biofuels <unk> .
this country , maybe a <unk> contributions and if you better to do when i expect to that would be great , but my core here is that we keep all those five have to work , and we ca n't of you give up , because they have <unk> , because all have significant problems .
we 're going to look at first this burning fossil fuels made up , burning of either of coal or natural gas .
you what you do n't need to seem to be easy , but that 's not you should all this co2 , that after the burn off the <unk> comes to catch , under pressure <unk> and then any storage and hope that there 's left .
there are some <unk> that this on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level of creating , but it on 100 percent to get it becomes very difficult to be . and a grand unification model for the storage of co2 to achieve that 's a big challenge . but that the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who will be sure ?
who can guarantee , literally hours a billion times bigger than any kind of waste , the you go from <unk> and other things we can imagine ?
that 's a lot of volume .

next , : <unk> .
who has been three major problems . cost , especially in <unk> countries are high . the question after security , that you really feel that nothing wrong can walk , despite the human <unk> that the fuel not for weapons , which is actually used .
and what do you with the garbage ?
because although he did n't it 's very large , there 's a lot of concerns .
so three really heavy problems that might be solvable by now , and making it 's why do it should .
the last three of five , i 've summarized why .
there are those renewables , how they often be called .
and who have -- although it is great that they have fuel you need -- they have some downsides .
one is the <unk> that these technologies create dramatic lower than the of <unk> .
that are <unk> , you talk from a lot <unk> , <unk> more area as a normal power station .
moreover <unk> these are more stalling ? ''
the sun shines as the whole day , they seem to choose not every day and it blows , of not continuously .
why has , if you from these are dependent on is , a way to have to the energy also be periods when they do n't available there is , to get .
there are here 's where <unk> . there are challenges of transmission . if we example , say that <unk> outside the country 's , you do n't just the technology , they also need to the risk for dealing with that the energy from where else comes from .
and there is that <unk> .
and the dimension to show , i thought , all kinds of us batteries , the be made , looking : the for cars computer , phones , <unk> , for everything and that i did with the amount of electronic energy , which the world using , compared . i found that all the batteries , which we 're producing , less than 10 minutes of <unk> storage if you .
we need here a big medical breakthrough , something that 's a factor of 100 vastly better be that , as the approaches to the time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not easy .
this happens , you 're trying to these <unk> sources of how we say , 20 percent -- 30 percent of the <unk> to bring .
if you get 100 percent to sustain want to do n't need an incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go this is the right approach ?
a manhattan project , '' ? how we come to target ?
what we need are many companies , the work . hundreds .
in each of these four areas we need at least 100 people .
at a lot of you 'll say , who are crazy ! this is good .
i think this story of ted group there are many people who get there was involved .
bill having that has several different companies , partly a company called <unk> the great <unk> it .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies , the great things make and interesting ways to have and i try this to support .
nathan myhrvold and i was funded a company that , you might not surprisingly , the nuclear approach to follow .
there are some innovations in <unk> ; and modular , liquid .
the evolution has this industry , some time ago i stopped , it 's no big surprise , some good ideas , lying .
this <unk> means that instead of a part of <unk> , which one percent , that <unk> , we decided to the 99 percent to burn , that <unk> .
that 's quite a crazy idea .

and because that 99 percent of burning , is that <unk> very much better .
actually burning of the garbage , and you can even the waste from one in the reactor , <unk> use .
instead of you about the head to break , you simply burn it . a great thing .
this highly enriched uranium is going <unk> uses , a little bit like a candle that .

that triggers that this is really <unk> .
here 's a picture of the gps in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . it became the part of today is burned down , <unk> so there 's <unk> uranium .
this <unk> the u.s. for hundreds of years on .
and if you <unk> inexpensive and just <unk> , you get plenty of fuel for the rest of our lifetimes of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to put forward to come .
think we have to our success on how should .
how should our old testament to look ?
now going to the goal , that we 're going to and then we 're talking about the <unk> .
many benefits of an 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
it 's actually very important that we go to get into .
the rest of 20 percent to be in the poorest countries to be produced , and still something that agriculture . hopefully will <unk> and cement , until then clean his
so , `` get 80 percent to reach , have the developed world , including the countries like china its <unk> completely <unk> .
the other note she says , whether we the <unk> technology and advocating , if you saw across the developed countries used is , and we the way are , you to the rest of getting severe .
that 's great deal .
that will be a <unk> this <unk> .
if we from there back , how do this is 2020 testament to look ?
it should come through the two elements is contained .
we should the <unk> use to reduce the way to bring . it became less we <unk> , the more dense as the <unk> be and then also the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things that we are companies that are not fully to the big <unk> lead , just firing , or even slightly less important as the other , which have <unk> of innovation for this amazing breakthroughs that represents .
this amazing breakthroughs , we need to <unk> track and that we can measure : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books to this topic .
that al gore 's book `` we have the choice . '' and david <unk> `` <unk> energy <unk> called the hot air .
they take it really , and create a framework , which this broad , discussing can be , because we need for support from all sides .
there 's a few things that come together , needs .
this is a wish .
a very specific wish that we do this technology to make up .
if you me just a wish for the next 50 years , allow , i could the president to choose , a <unk> , and that i love , i could this desire to choose the following , <unk> <unk> without adding co2 being invented . this desire <unk> i .
this has the biggest impact .

what we have we do ?
for which means for <unk> i mean ?
we have for more funding to use it .
if you have been taking place like <unk> meet , they should not only about carbon tax benefits .


we have the message .

it 's an important wish , but i think we can put it needs .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you just <unk> bit better to understand -- once , you can you have an idea of scale that investment to ?

the tricky step is that build the first <unk> , another billion to find that <unk> and the scene of fact , the first of it builds .
once the first job done is , when he just as i promised , then everything is clearly , because the <unk> , the <unk> is different than at <unk> , we 're used to .

bg : exactly . now you have the reactor ever taken all <unk> , there are many people and many <unk> , who go wrong can this thing where you do it opens and things <unk> or <unk> . this is not good .
but if you very cheap oil fuel that , you can tell him for 60 years <unk> -- you think about a bar on -- that they bury , without the whole <unk> .
and it there , and <unk> 60 years long , and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor , of myself a solution for the garbage is offering .
bg : yeah . now , with the junk that happens : you can see him sitting around -- there are much less junk shot with this method -- then take him and grab him in the next reactor and burn up .
and we start by looking for us to the junk food , the already exist of them in this <unk> or <unk> at the reactor 's . this is our <unk> .
so this is , for these reactors operate a problem was that , we came to fill and will become this <unk> dramatically reduce this is sort of the process .
but while you with different people , this world , across the ways we 've talked ,
where is that the largest oil interest , what really happen ?
bg : well , we have n't on a place for mandated and there is a lot more interesting <unk> for everything that `` nuclear '' in the name is wearing . there are passion and the people the company was in russia , india , china , i was here and i 've got the <unk> met and talking about it , like this for <unk> matches .
i 'm optimistic . you know the french and the japanese and have something in the direction .
this is another version of the one thing that has taken .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a faster the reactor and some countries have these are built , why is everybody , of a rapid reactor implemented it , a <unk> for our first .

bg : well , we need one of <unk> , <unk> things that are very low prices are , we secured 20 years to make up , and then 20 years to use .
this is sort of the <unk> to us the <unk> has illustrated that we <unk> need .
and , you know <unk> , if all good racing , and that 's a big wish , this may be easy to hold .
and fortunately , there are today , dozens of companies , and we needed hundreds of the , likewise , if those approaches worked , the funding for your drone pilots to work , for <unk> can .
and it would be the most , if it 's what do , because then you could a mixture of use .
definitely the we need a solution .

bg : a <unk> is that <unk> .
this is it even without the <unk> been , but that makes it so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there other innovative companies .
you know , we 've met whose job is not just about this , but there 's the standard modular way , this is a different approach .
there 's a fluid <unk> , which is something hard part , but you might say that helps us beyond .
and thus , there are different , but this beautiful thing is that a <unk> a million times as much energy has nothing like a , we could say a <unk> and therefore , if you with the problems can deal , who are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , in fact that capability , the impact on this country and other things , in a function of the league table .
if that does n't worked out , then ?
we need <unk> i introduce to try the <unk> stable enough to hold ?
bg : if you in this situation where does , it 's as if you too much has eaten , and the brink of heart sits on . what do you ? you might be an <unk> or something similar .
there 's a <unk> who <unk> called , who deal with various techniques went into to the warming to delay , to 20 or 30 years longer <unk> around us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you hopes that we do n't need .
some people say you should you did n't look at the insurance to work because one that might be lazy or power , so you 're going back eating , because i know that one of the <unk> save more .
i do n't know if that 's smart , is to get the importance of this problem the most fundamental , but now that 's a larger discourse in <unk> about whether you that 's available to have to be , if the things faster and come into this innovation , longer need , when we expect .
change deniers like : they have a or two possible sentences for the cell to you might want to convince them ?
bg : well , unfortunately , to live in the skeptics in very different <unk> .
the ones , the scientific arguments that make , are very little .
they say that 's a disproportionately negative , there , the with the clouds to have to the things are shifting ?
there are very , very few things that they do n't be able to say , which it 's an opportunity in a million there .
this <unk> here is like an aids .
you do is the mistake now , and pays for very much later .
and so it 's the idea , now , if you all kinds <unk> problems that , something to invest , which you until later , what has -- and to come to the investment is not clear that 's actually is the ipcc report did n't necessarily mean that the worst case scenario , and there are people in the rich world , who ipcc look and say that 's no big , drama .
the fact is , that uncertainty of us to worry about .
but my dream of this is that , if you put it economic can do , and the same time that co2 cleaned , then also say the skeptics said , it does n't interest me that 's no carbon <unk> , i wished to close to think it did that , but i 'm going to it might not accept , because it 's cheaper than the previous one way .
and that would your answer on this <unk> <unk> argument that , if you look at that time and energy use to this co2 problem to solve , all the other objectives to suffer , the <unk> , the fighting of malaria and forth , that 's a stupid waste of resources that is to pay to invest , as it better stuff there , which we can do .
bg : well , the actual expenses for the research -- we say the u.s. history , 10 billion per year will spend when they 're doing today -- that 's not just dramatic .
underneath it should be other things do n't suffer .
you come up to big <unk> , and you can make reasonable people disagree with , if you something that , that 's not economic growth is , and trying to this to fund . for me is happening here the most of waste .
it , unless you , is very shortly before a <unk> and financed , the curve . i think we should be more things to try to the that have tremendous potential , very much cheaper to be .
if the <unk> , to get all , a very high <unk> is , then you can only the rich to compete .
i mean , of us here could take five times as much for our energy to spend , without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even <unk> thinking about .

he 's still , because of his earlier in the story , <unk> associated , but he has understood that it’s a very rare group is , and so it brings up now this <unk> .
and this is a <unk> , the i take appropriate to think .
the research , it 's just nuts , how little bit of the backs up .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope that you wish you 're going . thank you very , .
bg : thanks .
so many years ago , here , i made , peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' ago .
the idea is quite simple . <unk> have the forming <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , reflecting . <unk> tape , reflecting . <unk> thread , and a marshmallow ; building .
the marshmallow , the top of his
and , although it really easy is it 's actually really hard , because it people are pushing very quickly work together .
and so i thought that is an interesting idea is that i and it a <unk> transformed .
it was a huge success .
since i talked about 70 workshops around shooting experiments , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> of <unk> and there 's something to do this , the depth of insights in nature of research that enabled and i want some of them to share .
usually they start the most people themselves in terms of task to orient .
they 're talking about you think , how it will look , they <unk> around power ,
then putting them a little time in planning and organization . they 're drawing out and put <unk> out .
they invest in a lot of their time in the <unk> constantly <unk> structures
and finally just before them out of time have to take someone the marshmallow and they put him gently down the top , entering a step back and `` <unk> '' and admire their work .
what but then , however , what happens is that , `` <unk> '' a `` <unk> '' will , because that weight of the marshmallow does that the whole thing to <unk> and <unk> .
there 's number of people , the more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have more than others , and under the worst possible for fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they cheat , they are confused and produce really <unk> entities .
and , of course , there are teams who are more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have and under the best for fresh alumni of <unk> .
and this is quite astounding .
as well let peter told you make them not just the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask you is how come and that what is with whom ?
and peter , `` none of the kids spend time at the head of <unk> <unk> to be ''
they invest in any time in <unk> .
but there 's another reason .
it turns out that mba trained by , the one right plan to find , right away .
and it 's going to realize .
what happens , if you the marshmallow for the top you pack , and they get out of time and what happened ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what <unk> do differently , is that they do with the marshmallow is beginning and prototypes to build , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow were the top , that they were numerous times , the ability to have <unk> prototypes to fix .
constructionists recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of a <unk> <unk> .
and every attempt to get the children are directly feedback , what works , and not .
so is the performance , using prototypes to work , lifestyle -- but we see again , how different teams to operate .
the average for the most of survival is about . <unk> , mba students to create the half of lawyers do something more , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who 's most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
<unk> is that highest , i 've seen .
and then they 're taking right-angled triangles , understanding and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to make stable structures to build .
ceos are about the average . but here it gets interesting .

it 's unbelievable . they look around and see , `` this team will win .
you can that prediction . why does this ?
because they have special faculties . of <unk> have .
they pour the process , they understand him .
and that team , that regulates body and the work <unk> going to the performance of teams to dramatically improve .
<unk> skills and <unk> and their combination of lead to succeed .
if you 10 teams have to the typical of expanding farmland , gets you ca . six , the robust -- structures that .
i tried to do something poses .
i thought we bring the <unk> alike .

what they think it happened with these <unk> ?
what was that ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone who have a <unk> high construction , built out , he had the price went home and worn away .
so it 's not interesting that high <unk> a powerful cooling effect that ?
we repeated this exercise with the same part of students .
what they think it was happening now ?
well understood at the advantage of `` <unk> ''
so we got off the same , bad team had fallen below the best .

there are mainstream <unk> lessons for us about the nature of the incentive and success .
you might wonder why would somebody in fact due to invest in a <unk> creating ?
the reason is , i need training digital tools and processes , put into teams to help , cars , games and `` <unk> <unk> '' to make it .
and what the <unk> do is , they help you find hidden assumptions to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .

and this is the value of experience this is so simple little exercise .
and those of them out of interest , can <unk> visit .
it 's a blog , where you see , how the marshmallow builds .
there 's a <unk> there .
they 're crazy examples from all the world , how people that to optimize and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is that construction , actually a <unk> sport is .
it requires that we all our senses at the task does and that we ca n't think about the optimal stopping to use the way our feelings and we do , the challenge , the front of us growth .
and sometimes it 's a small prototype this experience anything , it needs to us from a `` <unk> '' -- to a `` <unk> '' <unk> to bring .
and that can a big difference do .
thank you .
we do such as we would have here 's a machine ,
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a machine .
and everybody in this room must go inside .
and they do in the past , go , they 're able to the future go ; they can not in here and now remaining ,
and i wonder , they elect them , because i my friends in a lot lately that ultimately questioned , college , and they do all the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to the time back , before it cars were or twitter or america in the superstar ''
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you kind of nostalgia , to <unk> drawn is .
and understand that i .
i 'm not part of this group , i must say .
i 'm not in the past , and this is not because i 'm a <unk> 'm --
it 's a reminder that moves on the planet has n't go back , they go ahead .
i so in this machine , and i in the future .

there was never before a time , like this .
my <unk> died of all when they had 60 were .
my grandparents had urged this number of 70 .
my parents are of 80 on the <unk> .
there should do better a nine at my <unk> stand .
but it does n't even get people like us , because this is a major thing as this .
a kid , that today new delhi is born , which can expect , long to live as the richest man in the world a hundred years ago .
just think about . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is this ?
the smallpox . smallpox would have a billion people on the planet has killed .
they have the demographics of the earth 's a way that the way and shaped , how it 's no war , ever done it .
they are out . they are gone .
we have you <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world are diseases , the millions of us before the only one generation , threatened to have to get far more .
<unk> , <unk> , polio ...
and they do n't even if somebody , this is
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to billion people to feed , that are some successes of scientific method .
and my view is the scientific method , things to try to look , if it works , it change , if it does n't pretend , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately is that all the news , because there is a few other problems , and they were frequently said before ,
and one of it 's going to say all of our greatest achievements , a billion people on this world every day hungry , to go down .
this number drops , and they are rising very quickly and this is <unk> .
and more than that , we have our imagination to get used to explore the world 's very careful to trash .
drinking water , <unk> country , the rainforests , oil , gas station : they disappear , which is going to , and we have not from this chaos <unk> shall we also .
so the question is : we can do that ? i think it .
i think it 's clear that we food can produce , the billion people were fed up , without this country , on your life , to <unk> .
i think we can take this world with energy to deliver that they do n't the same time , destroyed .
i think that really , and no , that 's not <unk> .
but this keeps me at night , wake up -- one of things that is looking at night awake for . we have scientific advance even know so desperately took about how now , even know ,

we 're at the door to the amazing , astonishing design events on many areas . and yet i have in fact that we are hundreds of 300 years ago , the starting to go back , we would have to a time to find , we kind of progress that 's fighting have to the we think about these things <unk> <unk> have to with more frontiers in now .
people <unk> taking their faith , which is so intimately that you do n't be free will be here .
i do n't even the truth will be free .
and watch , everybody has quite a on his mind , even a right on his view of for progress ,
but you know what they 're not quite have ?
they have no right on their own facts . <unk> , they have n't .
and i have a while i needed to figure that .
ago for a decade , i have an article about , vaccination , `` crazy new yorker , '' written , a little paper .

i did n't know , i should do , so i did n't know what i always done , i wrote an article and riding on .
and soon i wrote an article about <unk> changed the food .
the same thing , only bigger .
so people were played a crazy .

but you know , i do so what i 'm doing . i wrote the article , i kept going .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we tap , we reach a , we eat out , that 's okay .
but these articles were worries me , and i could n't figure out why , and i would eventually it out .
and this is because remember that these <unk> , who taught me nuts were really does it 's <unk> were .
that were <unk> people , educated people , a decent people .
they were exactly how people in this room .
and that gave me this kind of clutter : ...
but then i thought , you know what to be we face :
we 're at some point , at that we 're not that same relationship with the progress that you know how much earlier .
we talk <unk> it .
we talk to be ironic that with a little <unk> tape measure progress . ''
okay , there 's reasons , and i think we know what kind of reasons that are .
we have this faith in institutions , authority , and sometimes in science to be lost , and there 's no reason , that 's not supposed to be .
you can just a couple of the name call and the people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can put your own list them .
there are questions and problems with the people , which we believed that they always right stuff . of you get skeptical .
and ask questions asked for your crappy evidence to urge you evidence .
take nothing else for granted .
but now comes full spectrum : if you evidence of give you have this evidence to adopt , and this , we are not good .
and i can that 's from the reason to say that we now an epidemic of fear for life , as i 'll never seen them -- and i 'll never see again will .
we 're talking about 12 years was a story posted , a horrific tale of the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in the connection to me .
very scary .
tons of studies have been done to see if that 's true .
tons of studies we should be conducted at this is a serious business .


it does n't matter . it does n't matter , because we 're encouraging anecdotes -- believe , we think , we see what we and how to believe that does that we really feel .

but you know what ?
this result of it was a catastrophic ,
catastrophic , because of this fact : the u.s. is one of a single countries in the world , which the immunization rate , <unk> harvested .

it 's awful .
what happened is that we do that could .
well , i understand that . i 'm doing that .
because it has anybody here <unk> ?
has a single mountain in the audience ever want to <unk> die see ?
what happens is not very often .
what happens in this country do n't actually , but the 160,000 times the world in the last year .
that are many deaths due <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because that 's not happening here is , we can be the crowd , and people like jenny mccarthy , we can see walking around and writing messages of fear and illiteracy , from the platforms like watching oprah and larry king live preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and correlation was not connecting .
they do n't understand that these things in would seem to be , but virtually never that same population are .
and this is something that we need to learn world , which is very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us by one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , polio , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle , not very much .
he called `` paul <unk> .
he has just with a few other people a <unk> developed .
he can the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing to save .
well , not ?
now this is good , except that what paul walk and over the vaccines , speak , and says , how valuable they are , and that people just quit ought to <unk> .
and that says he actually like .
paul 's so a terrorist .
if paul charges in a public <unk> talks , he ca n't no , armed <unk> statements .
he 's getting calls home , because people copying him to tell you to know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul 's a <unk> has done .
i do n't need this dude , but the vaccines are essential .
so you put them to continue to return to the diseases come back , terrible disease , and this is happening .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and this gets worse and pretty soon going to children back to die , because that 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not just a <unk> die .
what is , polio this ? take this . why not ?
a <unk> of mine has got a few weeks ago , writing and said she believes that i 'm a little too <unk> .
nobody has ever said earlier .
they would your kid 's not against polio to immunize people . on any case .
subtle .
because we can see polio have and you know what ?
we had in this country , yesterday , none of polio program .
now , i do n't know , maybe i entered this morning guy in lagos , in a plane and he flying now around los angeles , at this is he kicks in ohio .
and a few hours ends up and <unk> a car , and he comes over long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> tonight and visit .
and he does n't know that it looks with a <unk> disease or infected is , and we know that is not , because it works , the world now time .
this is the planet , we live . they 're not , as though he does n't is .
we love it us to lie to <unk> . we love this .
they have this morning everybody their vitamins had taken ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that you of the <unk> helps .
i know that they 've done , because half the americans , that every day , power .
they take this stuff , and you take alternative to cure , and it does n't matter , how often we figure out that they 're useless shapes gone .
the data up this time .
they <unk> their urine . i do you almost never .
that 's okay , they want to 28 billion dollars for the dark , urine of numbers .
i agree with them totally up .
a dark , urine . dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do this ?

we hate being too strong government . we have no faith to the system .
and that we should also not our healthcare 's mies van praagh .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> to get us , who does it can afford .
we go so from getting away , and where we’ve we
we walk into the poor of <unk> .
that 's great . i love the <unk> .
but you know that 's quite a serious business , because this stuff is crap , and we give a billion dollars for it out .
and i was all these artifacts here .
none of them -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , cheating , <unk> , there i do n't know , let me , this is , but we give a billion dollars for it out , it 's serious .
and you know what if i 'm saying that , scream at me the people in and what looks after it would like ? let the people are doing , they want .
so they feel good .
and you know what they 're wrong .
because it did n't really matter is , whether it of <unk> is , the `` hmm , i 'm going to the evidence of experts to the mammography does n't adopt '' or any <unk> , of his patients with <unk> treat want .
if you look at the trajectory completely transfer , where i think , and magic is presenting evidence and science to replace , get them in a place , on to do n't want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he taught about 400,000 his people around , because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more effective than any antiretroviral drugs are , which we know that you to emerge from aids , braking , can .
hundreds <unk> deaths in a country , this is worse than any of this disease <unk> will .
you to tell me not that these things have consequences that .
who have them . they first time .
now the <unk> epidemic , we kind of us that are , is this completely absurd that clash between the <unk> <unk> <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about metaphors .
this ideology , not science .
everything , we eat whenever <unk> , each branch <unk> , everyone about brussels sprouts , by the people changed .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no christmas tree . we have this all done .
we have it in the last for 11,000 years .
and <unk> it works and <unk> n't .
we 're <unk> , it has .
now we can it 'll begin to do . and obviously there risks . but we can sort of vitamin in rice mill doing , and this stuff can million people to help , million people , their lives to extend .
that do n't want to do ?
i must say that i do n't understand .
we refuse <unk> changed the food .
why we do that ?
now , i 'm always listening is a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we do n't want a huge areas with one thing , that 's wrong .
we do n't want to companies alive <unk> .
we do n't want to companies seeds have .
and you know , my answer on all this is
yes , they 're right . to fix that .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , and that 's not science .
this has to science has nothing to do .
it 's law of morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company is .
she 's no country .
she 's not have an idea ; she 's a process .
she 's a process , and sometimes it does he and sometimes not , but the idea that we of science , not allow them , their work to do because we fear that 's a real dead , and they keep millions of blooming .
you know , in the next 50 years we 're going to 70 percent more food crops to be in the moment . 70 percent .
that investment in africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
they need that , and we give it would n't tell you .
and why <unk> changed the food .
we want people not just encourage , this <unk> stuff to eat , such as <unk> .
<unk> is something that half a billion people eat .
it 's like a potato .

it 's out of nutrients , it has no one protein , and scientists to build all this is just as a real .
and then they could make people that food and you would n't be blind be .
they would n't starvation , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would be nice .
and everything , i 'll say that is why does n't fight to this ?
i mean , we ask ourselves : why does n't fight to this ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?



because you know what ?
if we do n't do that , if we can keep doing business as we make us a little bit guilty , at that we i think , and not guilty to say , high-tech colonialism .
there is that we have no description for this , what happened here .
it 's purely selfish , it 's ugly , it 's what do n't worthy , and we have this really stop them .
after this incredible funny , entertainment , you want so maybe you still in this ridiculous machine , and the future go ?
definitely the . that i want you definitely the .
now , put them in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can take this machine on all know , we want .
we can you <unk> , where we do <unk> want , and we 're going to where they move , where we want .
we have these conversations lead , and we need to think , but if we 're in the machine , it up and the future i 'm going to be happy to be , that made to have .
i know that we it can , and far as it was interested in terms of this thing , the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .

other words , <unk> have in some studies have a measurable effect shown in the <unk> , which is that 's ass , because who thinks , with her going to make a <unk> or a kind of ... in <unk> , for example , there , if the patient who are tightly enough believe , a measurable effect in the body who the <unk> calls .

in order to each other people to understand , i want you 're going on a fundamental , very simple trick that .
and i 'm going to show you how he works . this is a trick , the least input the 1950s , in every <unk> for kids standing .
i do we 've made from <unk> <unk> magic of <unk> in the 1970s , learned .
i 'm going to him for herself performing and it 'll explain .
and then i 'm going to explain why i would explain .
so you see what happens .
that knife , that they analyze it can make my hand , which they analyze it can .
i 'm going to that knife by just like in my <unk> think .
i <unk> my sleeve , back .
and to ensure that having my sleeve , go away , or from him the end result , i 'll just my wrist , right here <unk> .
this way to show you 're going to any time , anything happens . long as i 'm here <unk> , can not in my sleeve , hiking , or to emerge .
and that goal upon somebody 's easy .
i 'm going to my hand , open , and hopefully , if everything goes well , which is that knife by my bare physical magnetism would .


<unk> it !

probably familiar with a lot of you here in the room that trick .
he works :
i think that knife in my hand .
i say that i my wrist <unk> to ensure that having my sleeve disappears into the end , and this is a lie .
of the reason why i my wrist <unk> , is of that 's imagine that real secret of illusion is .
in the moment , namely , where i my hand of them <unk> that they feel them from the back to look at this point here , my <unk> , just from there , where it was , a position , of it looks like this extended is .
anybody trick ?
and go back page , somebody , of not a childhood had .
so , he sits down here . right .
and when i 'm <unk> , changing the hands on its position .
and now you could talk about , why does this delusion is , why you 're not talking about that down here 's just three fingers to see are because of mind and the way , making information and processed to do individually counts , one , two , three , but placing them as a group can see .
but it 's now here 's not actually . and then i open my hand .
of course it will probably would , but not by the magnetism body , but by a trick , through my <unk> , the right now there is .
and when i my hand up close to happen the same thing , i <unk> , by this movement , like that the fingers off again <unk> .
i take these hand away . and this is the knife .
this trick them their friends and neighbor to demonstrate . thanks .
now , has to the <unk> to do ?
a year ago , or so , i read a study that i really just blew up .
i 'm not a doctor or explorers , and so it was that for me an amazing thing .
it turns out , which is what it turns out : if you a <unk> it into a white pill to provide , of a <unk> , is that just a round , white pill , the one of measurable effect that .
but if you the shape , of them that <unk> critical , for example , in a smaller pill to change , and these blue dyed , and a letter to <unk> , is they actually a measurable , effectively .
and that , although almost none of any <unk> ... there are merely <unk> .
but a white ball is not just a blue pill .
what that made me of <unk> .
it was asking yourself , but that does n't understand everything is .
if you capsules that , are the more effective than traditional pills every form .
a colored the capsule that looked at the end of yellow , and another red is that 's better than a white capsule .
but the <unk> plays a role .
a pill , every day is not just about three pills -- and i ca n't do at the exact statistics , remember . sorry .
this point , but is , ...
... that 's also the <unk> play a role .
and the shape of a role .
and you read the ultimate <unk> have a chemist , has to the needle to reach .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> substance , who a patient <unk> .
that creates a very powerful image in mind . this is very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really begin … i’m going to do you another time to show , if we have a <unk> have .
the fact , is that the white ball and not good works like the blue pill , who are good works like a cramped capsule , who are good works like the needle .
and it has any that really <unk> property . it 's only our believe , the inside us a stronger the effect can leverage .
i want to know if i did this idea for a trick could use .
i take something that obviously a delusion is , and let 's really look .
we know that are capable of study that you to the needle to reach the fact , if it on the thing is supposed to go .
this is an 18th century . cm : long <unk> . she 's very , <unk> . and i 'll basically a little bit <unk> .
this is really my best meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not <unk> from hollywood .
i 'm going to do this needle in my skin , sting and through them through push , they get on the other thing <unk> .

i propose , so if you very quickly as bad will , then you look for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm going to the first <unk> part here back to do .
you can see it 'll see what they 're also <unk> , if you want .
so , it is , right here , where my ham starts , the lower part of my <unk> i 'll just a little <unk> do .
does n't mean really sorry . it makes you this crazy ?
and i 'm just a little bit through my skin and on the other way back out .
now we 're actually in the same condition that we do the <unk> had .
about .
but now they can use my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , i 'll show you . this is a two three , four , five .
well ,
i know what people imagine , if you see that .
they say , of this may be dumb , and <unk> itself in the skin , just for us a few minutes to speak .
now i 'll just show you .
look like this in this pretty good .
yes , i know .
and people back to say . i did n't that 's seen .
people in the <unk> come up in .
let me put it them out of closeness to show .
this is really my skin . this is not <unk> from hollywood .
this is my ham , and i can that <unk> .
sorry if you very bad going to look away , look not going .
people behind , or the , the that later , this was once a series on , we 're going to say `` well , that look at it 's fairly impressive event of , but if it 's real fact , he would , look , here 's a hole and there , if it feels fake it , it would bleed .
okay , i 'll just a low blood for you <unk> .
yes , here is it .
ordinarily would i 'm the needle and pick out .
i would my arm and clean up to show you 're not by lesions are .
but i think in this scale here and the intention , from a delusion is something real way , i 'm going to the needle , just in there let me and from the stage to go .
we 're going to us in the next days a couple more time you encounter .
i hope , you look forward , you 've already . thanks .
everybody talks about today about that happiness .
i have some people the number of books are among the time , the with <unk> '' in the title , in the last five years or published by and they gave after about 40 up , and there was much more .
there 's a huge wave of <unk> 're lucky to the explorers .
there are very much <unk> .
everybody would like the people are happier about .
but despite all of flood of work , there is what a cognitive function break that 's sort of almost impossible make , clear about happiness was thinking .
and my talk today 's mainly by these cognitive drop an act .
this is for <unk> , the about their own happiness to think , and it applies for scientists , which they 're lucky to think , because it turns out that we just mess are like everybody else .
the first of this is a <unk> , complexity of admit that .
it turns out that the word `` happiness is simply not a useful in the word is a little more , because we get it up to many different things were problems .
i think there 's a particular meaning , that we got to shrink it could , but in the great and all this is something that we give you have , and we 're going to the complicated tomes of view would have pointed out , the well-being is .
the second case is a <unk> of experience and my mind : basically consists mostly they 're trying to be happy in his life and be happy about his life or happy with his life .
and those are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the <unk> fact that we 're not a <unk> can think , of well-being is affected , without its significance to distort deeply .
i mean , this is a real cognitive and trap .
there 's simply no way , it right down to get .
now i 'd like with an example start by somebody , of a <unk> had a home of my lectures , of a story , covered . [ unclear [ unclear ] , he said , he would have a symphony heard , and it was absolutely <unk> music , and at the bottom of recording -- there was a <unk> <unk> sound .

but that i did n't it .
what it ruined had been the memories involved in the experience .
he had the experience them anyway .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
they <unk> not because he with a memory <unk> was ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all , he 'll keep it had received .
what about this really saying is that we 're talking about , and over the other people think we could be in terms of two types of self .
there 's a <unk> itself , that the present to live and the present and if you know , that is , the tiniest trace back to experience , but basically just the presence has .
it is that <unk> itself , that the doctor <unk> -- you know if the doctor does it does it got sore , when i do here <unk> ?
and then there 's a <unk> itself , and that <unk> itself is that , that <unk> and the story of our lives upright , you get , and it 's <unk> , that the doctor <unk> by the question how they turn this lately felt me ?
or did you have a journey began to albania ? i may .
this are two very different entities that <unk> self and that <unk> itself , and the two to confuse this is part of the <unk> the <unk> from happiness .
now this <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that starts really begin with a basic reaction take our memories grow up -- it begins immediately turned down .
we 're not just fictional stories , if we have set it , stories to tell .

and let them <unk> with an example start .
there 's an old study .
that are real patients , who get a painful procedure <unk> .
i wo n't let go do is today , as painful , but she was painful than this study in the 1990s . experiments done .
they were asked , everybody loses 60 seconds about their pain to report .
and here are two patients . that are your records .
and they 're asking who by both been able to have suffered ?
and that 's a very simple question .
the patient to b 's clearly has suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient to b , she had a patient to b , and more .
but now we have a different question how much thought that these patients that they <unk> ?
and here 's a surprise :
and the surprise is that patient to play in a lot <unk> <unk> at the <unk> had as a patient b .

and none of these stories is very <unk> or a great -- but one of them is this shows ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the , the worse is was the , where the pain being in the end up its zenith , was . it 's a bad history .
do we know that ?
because we these people after their <unk> asked them , and too much later , how bad was the whole thing in overall ? ,
and she was much worse , b , for a b in the <unk> .
now this is a direct fight between the <unk> self and the <unk> itself .
from the <unk> even had a b is a clear <unk> time .
now , you 're using patient to b to do , and we 've actually a clinical experiments , and it 's been done , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of the patient to b extend your phone by simply by the world filled up in it makes no to have to him to <unk> .
this will lead them , that the patient is suffering , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you that a few minutes off , who has does that <unk> themselves from the patient is a bad zoo of it is , and it does that <unk> themselves from the patient is a lot better now is , because now you 've got a patient to play in a better story about his experience has been .
time , draws on a story from ?
and this is for the stories that this memory that provides carbon-free and it is also for the stories that we invent .
do anything at a story <unk> are <unk> , great moments and ends .

now this <unk> even live life to be delivered continuously .
it has moments of <unk> , one after another .
and they ask , what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost forever .
i mean , the most of moments of life -- and i have this chairs -- you know the psychological present is true than about three seconds long . what is when you know that it 's in a life about 600 million of there . in a month there 's about 600,000 times . most of you leave any track .
most of you 're completely ignored by <unk> itself .
and it gets you 're sort of the sense that they count the thing that what happens during those moments of <unk> happens to our lives is .
it 's the limited resource that we consume it as we 're on this world are .
and how do we consume it would seem to matter , and that 's not the story that this <unk> even for us that keeps lettuces .
so we put this <unk> self and that <unk> itself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is of interacting with the time .
from the <unk> itself , if you a holiday you have , and the second one week in the same good is how the first , which is the <unk> vacation 's twice as good of <unk> vacation .
so does n't for this <unk> itself .
for this <unk> itself is a <unk> holiday you get better than the <unk> holiday , because there any new memories , added to be .
they have the story n't changed .
and this way is time actually the critical variable that a <unk> itself is different from a <unk> even time has a very profound impact on this story .
now this <unk> to make more than to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's actually <unk> , that the more true , because if you put patients have to the , we say , two <unk> at two different surgeons had and they decide which he actually pick up , which is the , the votes of , of the memory that , the less bad news is , and this is the surgeon , the selected will .
this <unk> itself has no voice in particular choice .

and even if we 're the future thinking , think we 're going to our future is n't usually as painful experiences .
we think about our future for more than <unk> memories .
and basically we can do that look , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> itself , and you can understand that <unk> even more than one , this sort of this <unk> even <unk> through experience that this <unk> do n't need .
i have the sense that if we spend holidays bring it does a lot of is , that means we make a vacation largely the services , the <unk> itself .
and that 's a bit hard to justify punishment , i think .
i mean , how much <unk> we of our memories ?
this is one of explanations , for the dominance of <unk> even gave up .
and when i think about , i think of a holiday , the we a few years ago in the antarctic 've done , the clearly the best on vacation trip was , the i ever had , and i think , more frequently used in proportion to , how often i got another <unk> think .
and i 've probably from my memory to that <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the past four years <unk> .
now if i 've become the folder has opened would have to 600 of photographs so i would have another one hour spent .
now that are three weeks , and that are its peak half hours .
there 's shining out of disagreement is to give

so i want to do is about a little gedanken experiment to think .
and ask yourself , their next on holiday you know that the end <unk> all their pictures that blew all over and they get a <unk> drug , that they 're not remind you .
now would you the same space holiday you choose ?
and if you another on vacation and vote would , there 's a conflict between her two types of self and they got to think about how do this conflict decisions , this is really do n't obvious , because if you in terms of time thinking they get an answer . and if you in terms of memories think they may have another answer to get .
why we the <unk> choose that we pick it 's an issue that at us out with a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self could drop two in terms of fortune on .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per second self .
you can ask : how happy , is that <unk> itself ?
and then they would ask : how happy that , these moments in life of <unk> itself ?
and they 're all -- fortune for those moments , is a fairly complicated process .
which are the emotions , the measured , they can be ?
and , incidentally , we 're now capable of a pretty good idea to get from happiness , the <unk> self-assemble over the time .
if you after knock out of <unk> yourself questions , it 's a whole other thing .
this is not about it as happy one person who lives .
it 's kind of how happy or a very pleased who is , if this person about their lives are .

everybody , of those terms n't distinguish will start probing the happiness to screw it , and i belong to a lot of researchers do about well-being , which is probing the happiness -- long screwed that on these same way .


and in the last that we started about this privilege of those two types of self to learn .
and the main one lesson that we , i believe we 've learned is that they 're wealthy people are .
you know how happy somebody with his life is , and that teaches you 're not much about how happy inside second life to be alive and vice versa .
just gives you an image of high correlation to convey , the correlation is about <unk> .
what this is that if you know someone would meet , and would tell them , oh , his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about his greatness all know ?
now , they were going to over its size , there are much uncertainty .
they have much uncertainty .
when i tell them that somebody would be life than eight at a scale from 10 <unk> that they have much uncertainty about how happy , he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know something about what the average happiness the <unk> intended .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is basically means that was pleased to be with people that we like , time to spend with people that we dislike .
there are other occupational pleasure , but this is dominant .
if you so this privilege of those two types of self to maximize that we want you 'll end very different things .
the conclusion from , this , i 've said , is that we 're lucky , i did n't imagine yourself as a substitute for comfort .
it 's a completely different method .
now , briefly , another reason , which we 're not clear about happiness can think is that we ca n't on the same things to pay if we think about this life thinking and if we actually life .
so when you the simple question , as happy people in california are you will not the correct answer to get .
if you ask this question you think that people in california to be happier need if you , we say , ohio gave life .
and what happens is that if you about that live in california to think , you think about the difference in california , and other places , and this difference is , we say , in climate .
now it turns out there 's climate is not very important for this <unk> itself is , and it 's not very important for this <unk> itself , that will decide , as happy people are .
now , but that , because <unk> itself is responsible , you get to end -- some people might end up in california are retracting .
and it 's sort of interesting to track , what happens to anybody who migrated to california , pulling in the hope , especially happy to be .
now you <unk> do n't going to become happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're thinking that they 're lucky ones , because if you think about that she reminds you 're going to an awful this weather in ohio state legislature was . and they 're going to feel that she 's the right decision to meet them .
it 's very hard to clear about well-being of thinking , and i hope , i gave you a sense of it gives , how difficult it 's .
thank you .
thank you . i 've got a question you .
thank you .
well as we a few weeks ago , phoning 've mentioned her face , that 's a pretty interesting and there , this out of these <unk> survey found himself .
this is something , what they 're going to participate can climb , because they 're going on a few minutes left would have ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think that most exciting results that we 're in the <unk> survey found that 's a number that we absolutely not to find expecting had .
we found that 's in terms of this lucky , the <unk> itself .
if we have <unk> , like emotion , with the income <unk> .
and it turns out under an income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a great representative sample , under an income of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 years ago .
dk : 60,000 years ago .
60,000 dollars in the year are people were distressed , and they 're increasingly <unk> , depending on the poorer . they 're going .
think we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i 've seen , so flat lines seen .
what happens , is obvious that money , no <unk> <unk> , but that lack of money , surely the misery <unk> , and we can do our misery very , very clear to measure .
in terms of the other self , the <unk> itself , you 'll get another story .
ever more money you earned the more levels is you .
this is not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american <unk> it 's about life , freedom , that the pursuit of happiness .
when people have been finding take seriously consider , i mean , it appears all the head to ask , everything , and we think for example , in terms of policy and forth .
there 's a chance , that politicians that the country in general one that finding out how to take seriously , like , and based upon politics are going ?
dk : you know , i believe that 's the recognition , there for the role of <unk> in the policy .
the recognition is going to begin to be in the united states , no question , but the uk happening right now , and other thing that you just .
people are now , acknowledge that they 're lucky to think should , if you the political thinking .
it 's a while to take , and the people will discuss , whether they <unk> explore , or whether they <unk> explore and we say , and so we have this discussion is pretty soon bring .
, how fortunate to increase can go very differently depending on , as you think and if they 're that <unk> even think , or whether they 're that <unk> even think .
this is going to policy changes , i think in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you look at this <unk> the population going to measure .
this will , i think in the next one or two decades of the national statistic is forever .
now it strikes me , this is subject to , or should at least the most important political debate to pursue be about the next few years .
thanks for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .


i have a plan for it . i want more people to convince including all of them , more time with the way to zoom and <unk> games to spend .
now , and we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think that 's a lot of time for games .
perhaps slightly too much time , if you consider how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve them .
but in fact , my research at the center for the future , according to that 's exactly the opposite <unk> .
three billion hours per week are not nearly enough to the <unk> problems of the world to solve .
in fact , i 'm convinced me to be able to talk about this next century on planet is survival level , we have this time to dramatically increase need .
i 've calculated that took time , 21 billion hours <unk> per week , lies .
this appears first maybe something <unk> , repeat , i got to make it affect ca : if we problems like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity want to solve , i believe we need to try to play online for at least , 21 billion hours per week from the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why this picture 's quite closely , why i believe that play , so critical for this is survival of human species in the future of these are seriously .
this is a portrait of photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings about play catch . it 's going to players have a camera and i built .
this is one of the classic expressions as you 're playing .
if you any players are , suppose you may be some of nuances in this picture .
you 'll probably this sense for the urgency , a little bit scared , but also <unk> concentration , to figure out in that solve a really tough problem .
if they also play , you see some of nuances . here , the way up <unk> eyes and the mouth that are a sign of astonishing optimism . eyebrows present it surprise .
this is a player , the edge of a so-called <unk> victory and accessible .
oh , you know that . ok. be neat . we have some outstanding players here .
a <unk> victory is a result , that 's extremely positive is that she has n't know that it does anyone was possible .
it was almost go beyond the imagination .
and if you 've got to reach , they 're shocked out they actually to do 're capable . this is a <unk> victory .
these players to the brink of a <unk> victory .
and this is it , we take millions of their faces of <unk> over the world , you need to talk about the barriers like the next century in attacking the computer . that 's face , whatever , the contrary of all odds , the edge of a <unk> victory as the world .
well , unfortunately , we see more likely to face in real life , if we 're difficult problems facing .
i call it as this , `` in life , i feel bad '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see , ok .
this is me , like me that `` in life , i feel bad '' <unk> do .
this is a graffiti -- in my former head home in berkeley , california where i in my ph.d , checking out why we in games are better than in real life .
this is an issue that many football players have .
we think that we in the reality are good for how to play .
and i 'm not only animals have successfully , although that does theirs .
we reach into <unk> more . i mean , in relation to the motivation , something <unk> to do inspired to collaborate together .
if we were in a <unk> are , i believe that many of us taking our best possible version turn , anytime and immediately <unk> are , persistent , this problem to solve are trying to long as much needed , it , <unk> again to taste .
and the reality , if we fail , if we ran across barriers , bump , feel that we often different .
we feel to overwhelm . we feel to beat . we feel uncomfortable with threatened , perhaps most depressed , frustrated , or <unk> .
these feelings , we 've never , if we play games to play there 's because it does n't .
and that 's what i 'd <unk> examine the molecule .
why is it to play an impossible to think , you could n't anything could do ?
how we can these feelings of the play in reality is spread ?
so i looked games like warcraft comes up , that the ideals that environment for the collaborative solving , offering .
and i have some things we realized that epic <unk> in <unk> as possible to do .

but not just any that mission as a mission , the perfect , to her current level at play it fits , right ?
so they make this .
they could never a task that you ca n't solve .
but always the edge of your capability , you want to get very hard . but there 's no unemployment in warcraft .
your seat n't go around and spins <unk> . it 's always been doing <unk> something important to do .
and there are tons of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people , who engage with you to pull his epic mission to close .
that we act in life is not just , this sense that would a <unk> tons of employees are willing to stand .
there are also this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're out there , and we 're having to do .
then we can get this whole positive feedback .

this constant , feedback , there are n't act in life .

i get in real life of feedback , not .
so that problem of <unk> like warcraft , is that 's like <unk> is , anytime edge of a <unk> victory to stand out that we prefer our whole time in these <unk> spend .
they 're just better than the reality .
to have all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years ago , spent , the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
this is not necessarily bad thing .
it might sound bad .
but about it up in context , they look at <unk> million years , began our first <unk> upright , to go .

ok , if we talk about , how much time we know right to play spend , it does n't just a sense when you look at the time in terms of magnitude of human development can see the stops , to is .
but also be appropriate . because it turns out that we , we 'll spend all available to refuse to use in fact that change , what we as humans , capable of these are .

that 's the truth . i believe in .
and look at this thing about statistics , which has drifted from a researcher of the carnegie mellon university was published saying the average young man of today 's a country with strong <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . age .
so , 10,000 hours , is an extremely interesting number , from two reasons :
i 'm going to start , for children in the united states are <unk> hours of the exact <unk> that they do in the school to spend , of five . grade to end of the high school -- if you never absent .
so we see a full <unk> , on the young people will learn , it means a good players to be , like everything else , you in the school to learn .
and may have some of this new book by malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' to read .
so you know how his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
she 's based on the great science of <unk> to be able to talk about 10,000 hours with the <unk> studying a random part of the subject matter to the 21st century . age spend , we 're going to master 's imagine .
we 're so good at whatever you want to do like the most famous ones , the world .
so , we have here , is a total generation of young people , the <unk> are .
the big question is so what good right there are the player <unk> right ?
because if we could figure that , we would basically never had never go <unk> human potential is available .
so many people we currently in the world , the least an hour a day with <unk> spend .
this are our <unk> . 500 million people , the remarkably well in `` something '' are .
and the next decade we have another billion players , the remarkably well in whatever they are .
if she does n't have heard ,
the industry develops <unk> , the energy savings and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , then players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , online can play .
you 're expecting an additional billion player in the next decade .
so we 've total of 1.5 billion player .
so i started to think , it is , what good to these games to master to do .
here are the four things that i found . first , i said <unk> .
okay , and ask this out how to extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is that urge , right away from doing things , a <unk> to master , together with the belief that we have a <unk> hope of success did .
players are always remember that a <unk> victory is possible , and that 's always be worth , it to try and you do the same .
players are not sit around .
players are masters of spiders poet of social nets .
there is a lot more interesting that often , the show that we 're not people more like , after we do you 've been playing , even if you have a bad beat them .
the reason is that 's lots of trust takes , with someone a game to play .
we rely on that somebody time with us to spend that the rules <unk> going to be that same cause that they 've got to <unk> keep .
so what enables that <unk> that grow of ties to trust and each other .
as a result of that we build a stronger form social relations on .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason that the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week in fact , sort , as <unk> .
the reason is that , if we play , we 're actually be happier about , hard to work , as if we wanted to relax , or doing nothing .
we know that we as human beings , optimal , work , if we were hard , significant effort to perform .
and the players are always ready , hard to work , if you the real job more nourishing .
and ultimately , epic meaning .
players love it 's part of awe <unk> missions <unk> <unk> to be .
here 's a <unk> to this to illuminate the light to do that . they 're destined for all of wikipedia that 's largest <unk> the world .
this second largest <unk> the world , almost over 80,000 <unk> this is of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about of warcraft , the web , collected more about any other issue in each other <unk> the world .
they create a very epic story .
they create a very epic source of knowledge of how many of warcraft .
okay , that are so for two superpowers , the to a single result running . players are <unk> , hopeful way of individuals .
there are people , who believe that they do as individual can change the world .
and that the only problem is that they believe , you can the virtual worlds to change , but not the real .
this problem , that i 'm going to solve four attempts .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is genius . he looked at why people much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , we 're going to witness of not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , and <unk> .
and that by an economist . he 's obvious .
and he goes ...

so he says that makes you actually a sense , because the player can in <unk> more to reach out in real life .
you can in games holds the social ties to knit together as in real life . they get more valuable feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says it 's currently building completely obvious that players are more time in the virtual world as in the real spend .
i agree upon time to , this is logical .
but it 's definitely not <unk> .
we need to start to the real world in a game to turn .
my whole inspiration comes from an event , that perhaps 2,500 years <unk> .
there are these <unk> cube , from <unk> . you know ?
in front of these fantastic <unk> there <unk> .
and that were sort of the first of humans evolved <unk> .
and if you with the mechanics of the ancient greek <unk> <unk> 're familiar , you know how do this story . story about how and why games have invented .
according <unk> violent games , specifically <unk> , in the kingdom <unk> during a famine invented .
supposedly , there was such a great famine , that the king of <unk> to a crazy idea , decided .
the people <unk> . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . it took an extreme solution .
so for them , according <unk> , that <unk> and agreed to a national energy strategy . a day would eat . the next day would play .
and they would have so in this <unk> figure out to be , there play , so fascinating these are and to satisfying to <unk> productivity , surrounded by that they 're going to think it 's nothing to food joint .
and then the next day would play . and the next day would eat .
and according <unk> survived as you about 18 years that famine , putting them on a day they ate , and after playing .
likewise , i think about today we play a .
we put play a cell to the suffering from the real world to escape .
we put play a cell to add to suppose , that the real world does n't work , everything that in real life does n't <unk> is , and we bring us what we need to come from the play .
but does n't have to end of that be .
that 's exciting .

they shared this kingdom , in two halves .
they played a <unk> and the winner allowed to a <unk> adventure , it undo .
they left <unk> and behold , on the quest for a new home . they 're playing field just as many people back , how it food was surviving there and we picked up with the rest for an area , of them flourish , over .
this is crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show that the <unk> , the later that <unk> realm of the topography , the same dna as the old <unk> effectively .
so we got , scientists recently moved in the notion that <unk> try crazy story actually true .
and we geologists thought of evidence of global cooling , who almost 20 years we took me , the famine explain how could .
so i could this crazy story of voices .
you might have actually get people through play rescued by looking for you about 18 years in games <unk> have and then these <unk> had , and this much about playing with each learned that they 're doing the whole civilization have saved .
so , that we can also .
we do , since 1994 warcraft .
this was the first <unk> in real the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they were about 18 years <unk> , we 're playing with 16 years ago warcraft .
i would argue , we 're ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of your civilization depended on the quest for a new world . take my own 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should look at <unk> that half of us an hour a day to make hanging out to problems in the real world have solved .
i know , they 're going to say , `` how we 're solving problems of the real world to play ? '' and exactly this question i mean work in the last decade at the center for the future is devoted to .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it blasts down from the way we have to understand why should .
we do n't want to try to the future , prior to say .
what we want , is the future to create .
we want to this in the best results , imagine . and then you persuade people <unk> , this idea in reality to happen .
we ask ourselves in epic <unk> ago , and give people who are choices , you to achieve .

this is the world without oil .
this game is by 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , which you get a <unk> overcome anything .

we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and tested . and we have you ever since over the last three years , accompanied shops .
and i can tell , it was a <unk> experience .
nobody wants to be life change , because it 's good for the environment is , because we it should .
but if you in a <unk> adventures are and told you get us about this oil out .
this is a fascinating about adventure , on that you go .


we have this game , `` <unk> '' at the center for the future that .
starting point is that calculation of a <unk> that the people have 23 years on the planet left would have .
of supercomputers -- titled `` global <unk> <unk> '' of course .
the action on the players , to sign , we have almost like have a <unk> '' <unk> forged .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it that `` <unk> '' there . they have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and just summarizes it you can save the world .
but in our basketball game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
the 8,000 player up playing this game , eight weeks long .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they <unk> can , if you , `` <unk> '' google .
and this last game we bring up at 3 . march out . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you this game to conclude , preserving them of the world bank , the distinction , `` social <unk> '' , major in 2010 .

we have a comic strip away . we have `` level up '' for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want them to invite , this game with young people to share , over the world , especially in <unk> , the most benefit , together and their own social <unk> imagine , the world to save .
let me go from the end .
i want you some questions .
what , they think that happens when the next ?
we have these fantastic players , we have games , the show us , we can do , but you have the real world has n't be saved .
well , i hope that they 're looking at agree that players , human resources are that we work in real life can use , and games to be a big meaning for transformation did .
we 've all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to close the social webs to knit , <unk> and this desire <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we 're putting a significant play games to hang on planet , another century to survive .
and i hope , they 're going to me like play history and play .
if i went through the next decade <unk> , i 'm looking at two things will say that we each <unk> future can create , and that we all sorts of play games can .
so i say , let the <unk> games are beginning of !
thanks .
i would you 'd like to , let me a few months at writing an article for <unk> wired , i notice is .
i 'll write down my <unk> fingertips , but i was , edit the <unk> already done , and i 've noticed at that i never seen in my life <unk> 've , that word `` the disabled , '' really means .
and i read them to post ago .

<unk> : posed , strong , exquisitely sensitive .
i have this list of a friend , according to read and i had once you laugh , it seemed like this ridiculous , but i 'd just to `` <unk> '' and i could n't <unk> , and had to stop to read and i 'll just collect over this <unk> <unk> and the time <unk> emotional shock .
obviously this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i 'd just thought that the copy 've actually be old move .
but actually it was a copy of the early 1980s , when i just with the elementary started and so began to my self from outside my <unk> <unk> building and to shape people around the other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i did not <unk> used .
i saw this post take seriously , i would have in a world was born , that someone like me as a person to perceive their dignity , whose life <unk> 'd uplift it was running can . today , but i 'm going for the odds and adventure , which i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i just immediately the <unk> of 2009 navigated directly and expect that i 'm here a <unk> contribution to think .
here is the <unk> version of this <unk> .
happen is they 're not much better .

but it 's not only about the words .
it 's about , we think about the people think that we do with these words to describe .
it 's about the values , the inside these words stuck , and how we these values construct .
our language affects our thinking and how we the world and the people around us see .
many <unk> societies , including the greek and the roman , have really believed that the <unk> one <unk> a great force has , because that , you shout <unk> , they also <unk> can .
so , we want to actually <unk> -- a <unk> people or a <unk> people ?
just have a human <unk> as a child to call to figure it 's essential to do not limit , and you have performances <unk> .
it would n't beautiful , you doors to open up ?
a person , the for me doors , has opened , my pediatrician in the <unk> . chair dupont , the institute in <unk> in <unk> .
his name , dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , how they 're able to think , the most americans do n't counted correctly just could . he became increasingly , dr. p. called .
and dr. p. carried away , very <unk> fly and it 's for the work with kids , just like created .
i found the time that i do in hospital , i spent some reason , just great -- up on my <unk> .

and just imagine , i even as a <unk> child with dr. p. negotiate for me and trying to this practice to stop , <unk> no success .

and when you can be doing , i give you a hundred dollars .
this was obviously just a lot easier to trick of dr. p. , i could have the therapist at doing that i do n't make wanted to the prospect that the richest <unk> girl in the ward in the second stick to be . but it 's got me , actually ended up , a my daily <unk> with newly sober eyes to see . so i 've made a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder now , how much of his vision of me as strong and <unk> young girl with my self is shaped its and i 'd like you 're able to me as one of nature of the strong , <unk> and <unk> person to see .
this is just an example of a lot , like adults in <unk> the comprehension of the child and stimulate can .
but as the world already <unk> examples of the <unk> prove that makes us our language , no room , you can imagine , we have all want them would say it every person to be able to call themselves <unk> people to see .


maybe that illustrates so these technological change clearly , because it , that 's always had another truth gave that every man of society , something very <unk> and very <unk> give you , and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus is .

that sentence by interacting with the odds that lives of the idea that success or happiness depended on , a challenge to master , without getting rid of the handle its associated experience by being . as though my life so successful running right , because i the kinds of getting a life with a prosthetic limb of the way could , but anyway , people to me with my disability to perceive .
but the truth is that we change . course , we 're all of the challenge was coined , whether they 're physically , emotionally , or even in both is
and i would argue that 's good .
tremendous odds are not an obstacle that we <unk> need to pick up with our lives better clear to come .
tremendous odds are easy to our lives .
and i <unk> them , the odds , as my shadow , to see .
sometimes <unk> i that it looks very mind is , sometimes it 's hardly to see , but he 's kept me .

there in life odds , and challenges , and who are just <unk> real , and each person walks into different order . but the question is n't know , we odds , clear class or not how we make sure to come .
so we 're not just responsible , people who we love , before <unk> to maintain , but they also insisted to prepare , well , and make sure enough to come .
and we <unk> our children have fallen , if we do you feel that they give that does n't customize to be .
you have two things i 'm sure to separate thing , of the medical care system , and amputation , and you 're going to the other the social policy about , i be disabled , happy or not .
and to be honest , the only real and so persistent and the disabled , with the me apart by which had , is that the world in and says , you ca n't deal with these other definitions of describing them .
in our desire , the people to protect , the us at the cardiac unit and you the cold , hard to the truth about their medical prediction , to communicate or even a prediction for quality to ask , which they expected , we need to be deciding that we ca n't the harbor , put that somebody actually be disabled , is .
maybe this is the decline of the idea that just put <unk> , in a broken , is , and how this to fix , for each one more profound disability than the pathology labs at themselves .
if we get people do n't <unk> treat , and not all of his evil forces and opportunity to perceive and to acknowledge , we make in addition to the natural struggle to you might lead to have to another disease .
we <unk> a people , the for our society , one worth it .
so we have about the <unk> beyond watching and us on all sorts of human possibilities to focus .
most important , but is that 's between the perception of our mismatch , and our magnificent ingenuity , a connection there .

it 's mine may be more wishes , clear to ask , we were a tremendous odds are not necessarily be overcome anything , but that we have laid out now , you to hug , they 're <unk> to put to also have a <unk> to use and perhaps in order to dance .
and maybe we make up the odds , as something natural , coherent and useful to see , and feel that through their presence being so <unk> .
in this year , celebrate the place where we were rebounding . birthday , by charles darwin and when he was 150 years ago about evolution has written , did darwin , my eyes , on something very real in the human nature -- pointed out .
i would be so <unk> : i 'm not the most of its way to survive , and it 's not the <unk> its kind of the best , the off to the changes most is adapt to be .
this conflict , creativity .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the capacity to people , to survive and <unk> , the fight the human mind , surely is , or being armed conflict to turn us .
so , again , change and adjusting these are the greatest , abilities of people .


we can we had to do something a gift .
we can odds , a new meaning to , the about hard times beyond .
maybe we have the odds , when you see the change .
tremendous odds to stand for a change , at the we have n't already adapted to have .
i think the biggest neurological damage , the we ourselves <unk> have , is to believe that we 're normal to be .
let 's face -- who is normal ?
there is not normal .
there is that the usual . this typical . but not that normal . and they would those poor , gray is sweat really to know , say , if it really do that would like ?
and i think we tend to do n't .
it would love to talk about this paradigm of normality versus another portion of options , or the strength to it even a little bit dangerous to ask , exchanging could . so we can the forces of very many kids , release , and they 'll invite men , their way in particular , and neither does it goes into society that 's a cleverer .
<unk> have found that we humans from the members of our society continues to do was claimed that this useful to be and a contribution to afford .
there is evidence suggested that have the neanderthals around 60,000 years older people and people with severe , physical injuries , paintings wore it , and this was perhaps , because the experiences in <unk> these people , for society , valuable was :
they have these people do n't be broken and largely ineffective policy ; they were considered anything special , and valuable , treated .
a few years ago , i went into the city in the i grew up , a <unk> in the rising , `` the red zone . '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there was a <unk> tomato .
it was the summer , and i had <unk> on .
and i hear , like a guy behind me thinking about this is not <unk> <unk> is .
and i <unk> me around and see these elders man . i did n't know who he 's .
and i meant `` sorry , sir , we know us ? i ca n't remember so if you .
and he said , `` well , they <unk> to get to remember .

oh , because of .
and of course it 's when you click .
now , that dr. <unk> , a man , the i just made narratives of my mother about this day i knew , because i think of course , very characteristic , to my birthday , two weeks , too late middle .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mom was in the holidays , and so they knew my parents the man of me the world i brought to do n't .
and because i can <unk> born , and my feet moving around them pointing out and i just a couple of the toes in this research and a couple of the toes , at the other foot had he was kind of <unk> , these strangers had the bad news <unk> .
he said to myself had to build your parents say that you never going to rolling , and that never <unk> be would like the other children or you to make up a <unk> life training could , and since having me just lying <unk> .
really extraordinary , i found that he <unk> my entire childhood , collected has no matter whether i would a <unk> in the second grade , i 'd won , if i 'm trying to <unk> one of a parade , <unk> road was no matter whether i grant , or one of my <unk> <unk> <unk> had , and he used these clips to his students to teach , <unk> out of <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x factor , this potential of the human , willing .
you ca n't enough to emphasize , how critical those underlying factor for the quality of people might be .

you see , dr. <unk> has to think about changing .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and watch somebody to handle , two different things are .

i wanted was necessarily a normal effect .
if you feel that today i 'm not sure .
and this is happening , because i do something with my legs , you 've experienced and not in spite of these experiences .
and perhaps could this change things happen , because i was so many people are faced am , the me the doors to open , you have , instead of people to encounter , the me to be constrained , or me an idea <unk> wanted .
you see , it takes just a people , of them live demos , how do their powers <unk> can , and they 're going through .
if you it 's someone to be able to move your own , inner power to activate , -- the human mind is <unk> -- if you do that , and for someone in a critical moment of a door to open , then they 're for those people a very good teachers .
they bring them at themselves , and doors to open .
the actual literal meaning of the word `` <unk> '' is rooted in the word `` <unk> ''


in the 1960s set up in britain 's a <unk> done . then were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` <unk> <unk> '' the u.s. , we call that when <unk> ''
the students will take notes divided .

they 've got about a <unk> period of students with a `` enough , '' the note , `` very good '' gave them . it was told you , they were <unk> that you very clever would be . and after these three months , they really <unk> written .
and of course <unk> it feels like this heart to hear that way around the <unk> been told , they were just enough .
and as it was then after the three months , too .
but only ones that are still in the school were -- apart from the students , the school <unk> had .
now , at this trial was that the teachers wo n't <unk> were .
the teacher who did n't know that something changed was .
you 'd just told that a bit of the <unk> and that are the students with the note enough . and likewise they have you something about teaching and they 're treated .
the only real sense of disability is a <unk> mind is a spirit , the broken up , has no hope that anymore . he find nothing more beautiful . it 's missing , our natural , <unk> curiosity . and our innate capacity of imagination .
if we 'll get it 's building , the human spirit people to support to continue to hope for themselves , and other people to move around it nice to find , inquisitive and <unk> to be then put that 's relationship forces that uplift it .

i want to a poem end , that by turning into persian poet named <unk> in 14 . century . it 's written by and from my friend , jacques <unk> told that . and this poem called `` the god , the only four words , if you know . '' `` every child knows , not the god of the name , not the god of <unk> , but the god the only four words , if you know , and these things to repeat , he says , only time : come to dance with me .
come to dance with me . thanks .
