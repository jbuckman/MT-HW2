you know , one of the great <unk> field trip and one of our delights the beneficiaries of <unk> research is , along with the people to live , who are at the old days when you can . their history , still in the wind feel , you on the rain <unk> rocks and touch , you in the bitter the leaves the plants [ taste .
just does n't know that <unk> still living beyond the milky way to travel , or the importance of myths , the oldest of <unk> its full of the importance now , or that the himalayas and the buddhists and still the breath of <unk> tracking , means to the central epiphany of physical anthropology research into memory to shout , that 's the idea that the world , we kind of life , not going to a total of meaning to exist only as a model of reality , as an episode one group of certain capabilities of an adaptation of our goes , <unk> successful in front of many generations of chose .
and needless to share that we all the same <unk> .
we 're all born . we teach children with the world .
we went through <unk> .

but it 's interesting is the unique <unk> the <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
now learning plays it do n't matter , whether it turns around the <unk> in the woods of borneo for about , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior , in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> the middle of the sahara . this is at random jumble of a colleague , i 'm a month ago in the desert , traveled i 'm or even a <unk> to hang the <unk> , everest , the <unk> the world .
all these people teach us that there are other <unk> , other ways , other ways to the orientation in the earth there .
and this is an idea that , if you think about , one with just hope to satisfy it can .

you can get this cultural <unk> as a <unk> imagine . <unk> can create more than the sum of all our thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , my inspirations and <unk> , the of human imagination , the beginnings of consciousness , generated by to be defined .
the <unk> is this great legacy of humanity .
she 's this symbol of all limit , we are and what we call an amazing <unk> species are able to .
and as the biosphere , increasing <unk> was that happened to the <unk> -- just do n't had anticipated speed .
not a biologist down for example , dare to suggest that 50 percent or more of all species on the brink of extinction as well , there 's just not true . and yet , this -- that <unk> <unk> the field of biodiversity -- equivalent to find out , for us as <unk> <unk> the field of cultural diversity , aka script is .
and the key indicator of this is that mass extinction of languages .
as any of them in this room was born , were on the earth are 6,000 different languages spoken language .
now is a language not just the <unk> the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is an expression of human mind .
she 's a means , with a lot of the soul of a certain cultures have access to the <unk> world finds oneself .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , an inflection point , a thought , an ecosystem spiritual and opportunities .
and of that are 6,000 different languages , you today , as we 're here in monterey , sit , exactly half of being in the ears of children <unk> .
they 're infants do n't have taught . that means if nothing done by , they 're actually already died .


and i know that some of them , but it 's no better way ? i would be the world 's not a better place , if we all just a language to talk to be ? '' and i say , '' well , let this language , yoruba be . let them <unk> be .
let them kogi be .
and then they would suddenly realize , how it would , if your own language that could talk .
so i 'd you today is kind of a journey through <unk> take away , a quick voyage through <unk> to try to it 's understandable to do , actually lost is .
now there are some sort of us , the kind of the forget that i mean , if i say `` different ways of his , really different ways of his nose job .
just take of the <unk> in the northwest amazon , that people of <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from east around the belly of sacred , snakes <unk> .
this is a little , which were cognitively far between the colored blue , and green is different , there that <unk> the forest , from the people depend on , <unk> is .
they have an idiosyncratic , language and a <unk> the linguistic <unk> 's called : you have to marry someone , of another language , talks .
so all this is rooted in the mythological past . this , idiosyncratic , at this big houses , which , because of <unk> six or seven languages spoken to be , but it that , had never will hear , of an animal learns language .
they only hear , and start off to talk .
or , one of <unk> tribes , with whom i ever i 've lived , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , that we first , in 1958 , peaceful and i contacted by .

they threw a shiny photos of themselves from the air to stand , we 've been a friendly gesture rate what would help <unk> you that these people from the rainforest in your life ever had never be <unk> had seen .

but the <unk> killing not just <unk> with the spear .
they <unk> at each other .
54 percent of deaths occur to happen through <unk> .
we followed the <unk> eight generations ahead and found two million cases of a natural death and when we see people with <unk> something about <unk> , gave them to that one of people that old , so it was that he 's based on his 've died , and we were killing him still with the spear .
but while they had a clear ignoring the forest canopy , the amazing thing was .

in the early <unk> years , i received a really amazing job , when i on my professor in the harvard , ma'am , i be interested in fact , in haiti to go and the secret societies appear to infiltrate that this foundation of magnitude of <unk> and <unk> <unk> was and that actually poison , that for it was used to <unk> to do , sure .

contrary , it actually is a complex <unk> upbeat .
it 's interesting .
if i ask her dignity , the major religions , on sale , they would say ?
christianity , islam , in buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent will always <unk> , because the conjecture that was that it in sub-saharan africa , there 's not religious faith to give him . course , there was an and <unk> is just that <unk> this very <unk> religious thought that during the tragic diaspora to the <unk> <unk> .
but <unk> as interesting things , is these are living in a relationship between the living and the dead .
the living bear the spirits .
the spirit can of them under the big water <unk> going to respond to the rhythm of the dance to the soul of living temporary rise to crowd , that the <unk> for a short <unk> moment to god will .

we use dancing in the temples , and going to god .
and because you became obsessed with your moment , you going from the spirit , held accountable . how can you damage <unk> be ?
you see these amazing -- demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> coal , without the burning <unk> , an amazing graph of the ability of mind the body like to influence that it <unk> , in a state of extremes arousal , displace it will .
now of all people that i 've met , kind of kogi does it 's from the sierra nevada and de mar√ßo in santa <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> .

in a <unk> continent , were these people who lived one , the way of the <unk> conquered .
it to the modern day , you 're going from a <unk> priesthood governed . education system that priesthood , but it 's quite exceptional .
the young <unk> be at age of three and four years of their families detached and a <unk> world of <unk> , <unk> at <unk> the glacier , for 18 years to separate . two periods of forward and nine years , deliberately chose to the nine months of pregnancy , and imitate at the in her lap , their <unk> mother <unk> , spend now , you <unk> in your lap , the grand store .
and during this whole period , they become a cultural in the value of their society has introduced . values , who claim keep that your prayers ; and just your prayers of the cosmic scene -- or we could say that environmental issues -- balance we keep the .
the end of these amazing <unk> 'll someday , suddenly left out in fact , and the first time in their life , at age of 18 years , you see a sunrise that . and this <unk> moment of consciousness from the first of light , when the sun 's starting on the <unk> of astonishingly beautiful place to ultraviolet radiation , which suddenly you just got in abstract 've learned in an amazing glory and confirmed . and the priest , and get back and see her ? it 's really , as i 'm telling them .
it 's wonderful . you do it to protect .
they call at the older brother and say that we that we the younger brother are , for the destruction of the world are responsible .
now this level of intuition might become very important .
whenever we 're aboriginal and the landscape of thinking , <unk> we 're either <unk> and that old or gossip were the fancy , wild up , which in his simplification of <unk> idea is , or other hand thoreau and say , these people more with the nature is connected , when we .
so , then aboriginal communities are not sentimental , yet , you were of nostalgia stricken .
it stays on much space , in the <unk> swamps , from <unk> or the cold wriggle around from tibet , they have but nevertheless , through time and my ritual which <unk> <unk> the earth are shaped , of not on the idea is grounded in , you realize is close to be , based on a far <unk> intuition , the idea that the earth , we 're just existing technology can , because they in this human consciousness <unk> will .
now what is that ?
it means that a little kid from the andes , that the belief that grows to the mountain in a <unk> is , of his or her destiny to determine , which is a very different person will , and a different relationship to this resource , or this place that , as a little kid from montana , that the belief that grows out there 's a mountain under a bunch of stone is , the <unk> can be .
if he 's the abode of mind or a bunch <unk> is , is irrelevant .
this interesting is the metaphor , which the relationship between the individual and the nature is defined .
i grew in the woods by <unk> colombia , and i believed that these forests , there are , <unk> to be .
this made me to a other people as my friends , under the <unk> , who believe that these forests of the abode of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> spirit people are , the most <unk> the world , housing , the spirits , which they 're doing <unk> engage them .
now if you start to the idea to look at that these cultures across different realities of creating it can , you some of their extraordinary discoveries to understand . example . this plant here .
it 's a photo , that i just last april , in the northwest amazon <unk> .
this is <unk> , of a lot of you 've heard that most powerful <unk> <unk> from his repertoire of <unk> .

this plant which includes some intense <unk> the sort of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> . pretty well .
if you 've been through the <unk> 've seen , how do this stuff <unk> , this substance of them from various ways to create permanent entity which is also <unk> .
this <unk> to <unk> that 's about how much of a <unk> <unk> to be , <unk> of <unk> paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it 's no distortion of reality is produced , but the resolution of reality .

but the deal with <unk> is the that they do n't <unk> held to be able to go away by a in the human gut , obviously <unk> enzyme that with names <unk> , <unk> be .
you can only connection with some of different chemicals <unk> held by going to the mao <unk> .
now that 's fascinating that the <unk> that in the <unk> are contained , <unk> of the same kind of these are , which is necessary to the <unk> to <unk> . you ask yourself so even

we use these great euphemism , trial and error , being meaningless disagree .
but we ask you the native to tell you the plant is talking to us .
so , which means that ?
this tribe , the <unk> , that 17 different varieties of a <unk> that they all at great distance in the forest realize that for our eyes , as sort appear .
and then ask them , like your taxonomy arguably , and they say i thought , you understand something from plants .
i mean , do you know nothing ? '' and i said , `` no .
so , it turns out that you any of 17 different varieties , <unk> <unk> and they sing a in a different <unk> .
now this brings you have a ph.d. in the harvard , but it 's more interesting than <unk> to count .
now this <unk> this problem is that even those of us , of sympathy for the tricky position of indigenous people , they 'd <unk> and <unk> watch them , but somehow the past , shrink , during the real world , concrete world around us , progresses .
so , the fact is , you look at that the 20th century . , 300 years , not for his righteous war or technological innovation , i remember being , but rather an era , the we <unk> was and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity around the earth , either take action , supported it passively and accept . this problem is not the change .
all cultures have to keep in the the dance with new <unk> involved .
and this problem is not the technology making yourself .
the <unk> they had not less on the sioux refused to be , when they bow and the arrow did , as the americans who stopped americans to be , when you a horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology could threaten the integrity of <unk> . it 's do that ugly faces of the regime .

or if we in the mountains of tibet go , where i <unk> much <unk> , which you that ugly faces of political and dominance of those .
you know the genocide that <unk> extinction by people 's generally a convicted of it , but <unk> , the destruction of lifestyle of people , will not just not be convicted of , but generally , and <unk> as part of a <unk> celebrated .
and they do that suffering <unk> n't understand , if you do n't it on <unk> level , we have experienced .
i left off with a young artist colleagues are 6,000 of miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> through <unk> after <unk> and just as i went <unk> came , i saw that 's face , behind the statistics from whom you can hear . 6,000 holy <unk> that in the rubble , and ash into 1.2 million people that during the cultural melting of the <unk> killed .

and that meant he was during the chinese invasion was instantly i had killed myself .
his uncle '' bug , their sanctity in the diaspora , people to nepal , bringing them .
his mother was locked up , more unusual punishment for -- for this crime as wealthy to be .
he was in the age of two in this prison smuggled to knock themselves under your <unk> to hide , to do without it 's not life could .
the sister , the these <unk> did <unk> , getting a <unk> brought them .
one day , joined them are accidental death on a tags <unk> and for these <unk> her for seven years in a heavy camp .
this suffering <unk> can become intolerable be , but the <unk> spirit of people 's something <unk> .
and the end we 're really was a choice . we want to <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity of life ?
margaret mead , the great . anthropologist who said before they died , that 's their greatest fear is that as we have to pull one thread , <unk> , <unk> upbeat has to move , we 're not just the whole range of the human imagination run into a <unk> way down to see them , but that we should someday come from a dream to wake up , and i 've forgotten to think it 's ever other possibilities that there .
and it 's really humbling to go up to think that our genus but perhaps been 600,000 years exist .

the modern industrial world as we know it 's hardly see 300 years old .
well , these <unk> history tells me not that we all the answers on the challenges have , which we in the next for thousands of us stand .

and this song we 're going to the ability to rediscover that to be , we are people with <unk> consciousness , who get the importance are aware that all people and gardening , a really thriving -- to be able <unk> to . and there 's great moments of the optimism .
here is a picture , that i went around the northern end of <unk> <unk> , when i do <unk> on the <unk> went . and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his <unk> .
the canadian government is not always very well with the <unk> handle , and during the <unk> years in <unk> of <unk> our regime , they were forced me , settlements , to draw .
the grandfather of this old man who refused to .
the family , the fear to be life had , took him all of guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that <unk> no fear of the cold have they used to get your advantage .
the <unk> their <unk> were created originally from fish , the in <unk> wrapped up , made .
the grandfather of the man , feared he does not on the arctic night , or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> went out that allowed his pants off <unk> down and <unk> in . and when the sewage to seize that started , shaped by them in the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> saliva , on the sides of <unk> and when it completely frozen was , <unk> he 's a dog with it .
he <unk> the dog and the improvisational play a <unk> , took this skeleton of the dog , and the improvisational a <unk> , <unk> one other dog on and <unk> about the <unk> with the <unk> a shelter belt .
you can kind of nothing to do something .
and this is on many ways of a symbol for the resistance of <unk> and all indigenous people in the world .
the canadian government had the <unk> in april 1999 , the complete control over an area back , that 's bigger than the california , texas , together .
it 's our new country , and i mean <unk> .
it 's a <unk> area . they control all <unk> .
an amazing example , as one nation , the nation that was atoning with his <unk> search and we can break .
and ultimately , i believe it 's pretty obvious , for those of us , the to these distant aim for the earth states are , to realize that they do n't realize you are .
they are the <unk> from someone else .
they represent the parts of human imagination who in the past , times <unk> . and for all of us to be the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children are part of geography of hope .
what we at national geographic and ultimately to try is that we believe that politicians can never achieve something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> not on board is , but we believe that storytelling and the world can change and therefore we 're probably the best of the institution for storytelling in the world . our website that into the 35 million <unk> every month .
156 nations can send our tv channel .
our science magazines in the millions of people reading .
and we try to do a series of travel in <unk> , on whom we our audience to places of such as cultural wonder whether you take them to pull from <unk> <unk> be . and hopefully , they become one after another the central epiphany of physical anthropology , would say that this world 's made it , on different ways to exist , that we have a <unk> in a really very multicultural <unk> world can find them , one of the wisdom of all people to our shared and well-being we can contribute .
thank you .
what i tell the first thing as fast , going to show , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we 're doing microsoft , as part of a <unk> ago exactly a year to vomit have this is <unk> . and it 's an environment , of them either the local or take away with huge amounts of visual quality data can deal .
we see a lot of gigabytes of a digital photographs here , who will seamlessly , continually <unk> , pan , on any way they 've taken care arrangements that can .
and it 's no matter , how many of information we look , how large that collections , are or how big the images are .

it does n't matter , because that the only , the performance of a system like this is constrained can , is the amount of <unk> on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible , architecture .
this is a whole book , an example for <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> of <unk> . any <unk> is a chapter .
so to prove that 's actually looks a text and not a picture of satisfaction , we can you do that they really get to show that 's an actual representation of <unk> and not an image is .
maybe this is an artificial kind of a <unk> to read .
i would it does n't recommend .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy from the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you really this pleasure and the good experience a real <unk> a magazine , or a newspaper to read , we 're kind of the medium with several scales is .
we also something on the corner of these special edition of the guardian .
we have a false ad campaign with very high <unk> designed that much higher than normal revolution is one page ad is , and we have extra content , added .
if you the features of cars look like , they can see here .
or different models , or even reverse engineering <unk> .
and that reaches into that these ideas on , these constraints , for the available social space on the screen <unk> .
we hope that this is not <unk> and other nonsense over means that should n't be necessary .
of course , that is mapping of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i 'd like this really not much time to spend , except to say that we have to this area that contribute to .

<unk> on top <unk> picture of nasa .
let 's just do something of businesses .
this is actually now live in the internet . you can see it <unk> .
this is a project with the name <unk> that 's really two different technologies to connect .

and rick <unk> from microsoft scientific experiments done . a very good work .
so this is live in the internet . it by <unk> driven .
you can see that , if we sort of views of creating , which we went through imagery to penetrate , and that experience of <unk> <unk> do .
but the spatial configuration of imagery is here in the fact of meaning .
the <unk> have these pictures together would make them the real space in which is that these , the one of closeness of <unk> <unk> in the canadian rockies were made , 32 . you see pieces of <unk> slides , or <unk> <unk> and these things were all in perspective in relation to each other every now .
i 'm not sure , if i still time i did you very different environments to show .
there 's kind of a lot <unk> are .
i wanted to look straight one of <unk> datasets of noah had to show and this is from an early prototype of <unk> at that we first time in summer , we 've been working to them to do this , what i believe that 's really the kicker is behind this technology , the <unk> is , and this is not so obviously , if you the environments , consider that we the website that .
we had to us , because of lawyers , etc . worry .
this is a <unk> the cathedral <unk> lady that exclusively in the computer with images from flickr <unk> . give you just <unk> lady in the flickr , a and they 're taking pictures of men in t-shirts and on <unk> etc . machinery . any of orange <unk> represents a picture , that when i get this model <unk> discovered .
they 're all of this <unk> , and they all stand in perspective in this way in relation to each other .
and we can take these very simple way to navigate .
. you know , i 've never believed that i ended at microsoft 're going .
i 'm intensely grateful for the new reception hall over here .
. i suspect , you can see that many different kinds of cameras are all is now , of <unk> to professional <unk> , quite a number of them , the all this environment <unk> .
and when i 'm going to some of weird thing .
many of you 're ' faces and actually covered , etc .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here are you .
this is actually a poster of <unk> lady , got this recording was .
we can get rid of the poster to a physical view of these off switch .
the point is here , that we can come up with the social environment , and then can it will now data from all gathered together -- from the whole collective , memory of visual the planet looks -- and everything becomes deeply interconnected .
all these photographs will become interconnected and it 's something that 's bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model , this from around the earth emerged out .
and look at this as the sequel of work of stephen <unk> a virtual earth opposite .
and this is something that through the complexity , with the people 's not use it grows and whose purpose and for the user , with the application gets bigger .


and of course , the byproduct of all limit that , these immensely toward the virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that 's not only by <unk> or a satellite and so on keeping separations were , but through collective , memory .
thank you .
. understand where i do right ? their software has allowed to a certain point , within the next few years all images , the from someone in the world together to be used in principle that encourage everyone else might be
yes . they 're doing nothing more than to explore .
if you put them to hyperlinks , between the slides .
and she does this based on the content in the slides .
and this is really exciting , if you the amount of <unk> information i think that many of these images have .
as if you a <unk> for images to change it , where they sentences as input and the text on the site itself contains a lot of information about , which is a picture this is .
but how would be if this picture of them , to their pictures as much ?
now , which is the extent of <unk> <unk> and the wealth , who actually raises , really enormous . it 's a classical <unk> .
<unk> , this is amazing . congratulations .
they have , thank you .
i 'm going to be some things from my book , telling the one , i hope , in unison with other things are the they 've already heard . and i 'm trying to a couple of connections to create , if you do n't have noticed there are .
i want to the beginning , i `` <unk> dogma binding . '' i call .
that the official dogma of what ?

that the official dogma does : if our target that to maximize the <unk> our own citizens who is , about this , especially through <unk> of freedom of individuals .
the bottom up , is that freedom to itself is good , valuable to make sense , a <unk> requirement for that human .

the way of freedom to maximize that 's a choice to maximize returns .

this is , i think , deep in our water supply essential to think it 's any subject in the sense they would be able to life .
and it 's also deeply into our lives are rooted in .
i 'm going to be some examples of this mean , let us modern economic progress that allows us .
this is my supermarket . not a big .
i 'd just briefly about <unk> say .
there than 175 <unk> in my local supermarkets , if you the 10 different extra <unk> n't <unk> and 12 <unk> that they buy it could get a huge amount of promoting the lettuce <unk> manufacturing , which <unk> case that none of 175 students in the store , she 's okay .
so that 's like the grocery store is .

we can <unk> million distinct <unk> facilities <unk> from the components that in a business offered to be .
you must admit , that a large selection is .
in other domains -- the world of communication .
there was a time , when i was a boy , there , you could use every single cell phone , hosts have to you wanted , if there 's kind of an ma bell was coming .
they 've got your phone <unk> . they have it <unk>
a consequence was that the phone ever broken up .
these days are over .
so we now almost an infinite selecting on telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
those are the mobile phones , the future .

and you do this to do n't even in your business and i 've seen , you can be sure that they do it 'll soon .
and what it does is it makes you persuade people in business to walk and this to ask .
you know now what the answer that question is
the answer is no .
it 's not possible a cellphone , to buy that 's not too much does this .
in other aspects of life , the very much <unk> as this purchase from <unk> are , meets the same piece of explosion of choices too .
health -- it 's no longer subject of in the united states that they provide a ph.d. 's go and the doctor says that to do is .
instead , they 're going to the doctor and the doctor says , you : we could play do or we could call b to do .
b has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what we want to do ?
and your doctor , what i do ?
the doctor says , b has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what we want to do ?
and if you do so i would , doc , we would you do ?
the doc , but i 'm not you .
this result is -- we call it 's fully failed . '' that sounds like a good thing , but the reality is a shifting of burden of responsibility for this is hit by making decisions by someone of something i know <unk> the doctor -- to someone of nowhere you know , and likely , is sick and why not in the best constitution , is a choice to meet -- <unk> the patient .
there 's now , marketing , <unk> drug for people like them and i got this , if you think about , does n't make any sense , because we do n't buy .
why do n't advertise on them around us , if we 're not able to buy ?

something <unk> how our identity is now a question of choice , this slide show up .

and we make up , how many new way we want .
that means every day , if you can get the morning everybody wake up , they have to decide , for a kind of person you might want .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time , of the <unk> was that almost every one had and that she quickly <unk> as you could , and then , as kids got as you could .
the only much choice , `` who '' , not turn off , and not what they did it did .
nowadays everything is easy to have .
i teach , making smart students , and i 'll give you 20 percent less effort and when i used to action .
and that 's not because they 're less sense are , and not because they are more carefully now .
it 's because you with other things are engaged , you ask yourself , `` do you get married , or not do i 'm going to marry ?
do i went to marry ? should i 'm going to have kids , broke scientific career making ?
who are all <unk> questions .
and they 're going to answer questions regardless of whether that the way the tasks to make the i tell <unk> and no good note in my class , to get .
and the fact , you should be able to do this . this are important to <unk> questions .
that work we 're blessed , as carl illustrates that , with the undergraduate the allowed us every minute of every day from any place on the planet to work up on this <unk> hotel .
there are actually a corner , of me any subject , you 're going to set of this <unk> works .
i 'm going to it does n't tell you , because i use it wants .
so what it means that this extraordinary freedom of choice we have in terms of work harder choices to meet , and again , and again , whether we work should do n't work should .
we can our kids playing football games could n't look , and we have our mobile phone at the a hip , and your blackberry , at explaining the hip , and our laptop is probably going on our lap .
and even if you all off , are , every minute into the to our child soils <unk> one <unk> watching . we ask ourselves as well , `` i should this call would ?
i should be on this email answers ? i should devote this letter writing ?
and even if the answer to the question `` no , is it 's going to be sure their experience the <unk> your child <unk> very different than it would ever .
everywhere , where we look closely , great things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in the we lived looked like .
then i want to say there are some of choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in the now we live looks like .
and the question is , that make good news or bad ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what good thing is , i 'm going to be thinking about bad thing is .
those choices we have two effects , two or negative effects on people .
an effect , <unk> way , is that he paralyzes you to be free .
with many options out of the you choose one , drops it people very hard to have to decide .
i 'm going to another <unk> -- i 'll spend an , a study about investing in private voluntary <unk> .
a colleague of mine had access the <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> from about one million u.s. employees and indeed . 2,000 people different jobs .
and what they found was the number 10 <unk> the of esteemed employer <unk> , took the ticket to two percent .
they 're offering 50 <unk> at -- 10 percent of staff are taking part of as if you just five offer myself .
because it 50 <unk> are , the time dealing with the world , it 's hard to decide what you choose which rumor that they do it on tomorrow <unk> .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow 's obviously never .
you know that it‚Äôs not just means that people <unk> need to eat when you can to retire go , because they 're not enough money to travel have , it also means that make such is that they 're <unk> your employers to miss .
through not the ticket to give them to 5,000 u.s. dollars per year on from the future employer , the happy have been to their contributions to reproduce .
paralysis , is an episode of a lot of choices .
and i think it actually , that the world looks like .
they want to the decision really striking , if it for all eternity is , right ?
they do n't want the wrong investment fund them , or do this false <unk> .
so this is kind of an effect . of different effect is that even if we of paralysis and get over and an independent decision-making , the end we 're less happy with the result of selection , as to talk about the ability to have gotten ourselves from the other ways to decide .
and there 's several reasons for this .

the greater possibilities that there , the more easy it 's anything to regret that 's very disappointing for the choice that they meet .
secondly , economists <unk> call .
dan , gilbert 's a big point this morning , made by telling you how much the way in the we evaluate things , depends on it to what we it 's compare .
well , if it 's a lot of alternatives to think there , it 's just look more attractive characteristics of agency of alternative that they exclude , that makes them less happy with the alternatives that they voted it .
here 's an example . for the rest of them , who are no new yorker , are , apologize for me .
but here is , they had n't think should .
here 's a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
gorgeous , the beach . great day . they 've got everything for themselves .
what could be better ? oh damn , '' the man who thinks , `` it 's minimum .
my <unk> neighborhood , is gone .
i could directly dependent upon my house park .
and he spend two weeks of the idea that tracks that 's the opportunity to miss it , day , from one day , a great parking lot to have .
<unk> cut the average happiness that we created by our sample of maintaining , well , if that what we chose to have an amazing thing is .
and the greater possibilities , it to preserve well , the more attractive properties of selection are going to <unk> account .
here is another example .
now within this is doing some statements .
he makes a statement about the now to live , and perhaps talk about things are starting to do .
but a big point , the he does is always , who would you for one thing to decide they were the other things not to do .
and these other things like many more attractive properties have , and it 's going to do there are going down appealing to do .
three : <unk> the expectations .
this has found myself met , when i my jeans , exchanging the molecule .
i 'm wearing jeans , all the time .
and there was a time in the it just designer jeans is a form there , and they have you bought , and they 're bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and if you take long enough , driven and often enough to be bathed in which , they started out , `` ok , '' <unk> .
so i went to grow new jeans , to buy after many years of <unk> the old , and i said , `` i 'd been a little blue jeans , here 's my size .
and the sales person said , `` you lean people , easy <unk> or blue whales ?
do buttons , or <unk> ? rock or acid bathed in ?
they want to jeans , with holes ?
want them down to cut , <unk> , blah ... '' and forth , he told .
my jaw was down and after i 've recovered and i said , `` i 'd like the kind of the past the only way up .

i 'd be better . all these large sample of supporting me a it better to have .
but i felt bad .
why i wrote a whole book to try it myself to explain .
the reason that i got worse , i felt was , to all this available social choices , my expectations for me , for a great some blue jeans is n't mind , went up .
i had very low expectations . i did not a concrete expectations , when it 'll just a form there .
when you in a hundred species that came to damn well , one of you would be perfect should ,
and what i got was fine , but it was n't perfect .
and so i compared me what i had received to from what i expected , and what i had been very disappointing results in comparison to from what i expected .
this add some of opportunities in this life of people increases that inevitably the expectations of people were about how good opportunities that will be .
and this leads to any satisfaction to the results , even if the results are good .
nobody in the world of <unk> know i do because , if you it would , you knew what they all know what 's a point here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , that used everything was better than anything worse that was , than anything worse that was , it , for people could experience to make the a nice , surprise was .

you 'll never pleasant surprised . because your expectations , my expectations , <unk> are .
this secret to <unk> -- this is what they all come for this secret to <unk> are low expectations .
i 'd say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i started with a wife annie perasa married , i am , and she 's really quite wonderfully .
i would be better do this . i do n't <unk> .

ultimately , a consequence of <unk> a bad <unk> jeans , if it only one way to buy there is that if you <unk> are , and they 're wondering why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you can do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of blue jeans are available , and they buy a the very disappointing is , and they ask why , who 's in charge ?
it 's also recognized that answer the question is you .
they would be better , can do .
with a hundred different kinds of blue jeans is the windows , there 's no excuse for error .
and so , when people make decisions , and even if the results of choices are good , they feel keenly disappointed about them <unk> themselves .
clinical depression have exploded in the industrial world in the past generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also the suicide , is that people have experienced the very disappointing are because their software standards , so high are . and then if you these experiences himself to explain to , you think it would your fault .
and that 's <unk> that let 's generally better go , objective , and we have a bad feeling .
so let me just so if you .
this is the official dogma , this one that we all for really think , completely wrong is it 's not true .
there 's no doubt that some selection is better than any , but it follows are not that more selection is better than some selection .
there 's a magical lot . i do n't know what it 's .


there are many places in the world , and we have a lot of a lot of you heard , their problem is not the too large selection is .
your problem is that you to notice they have .
so the things about the i 'm talking about are an odd , the problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what is extremely frustrating and anger is steve levitt would have been here yesterday about talks like this is more expensive and hard to <unk> <unk> n't help . it 's a waste of money .
what i 'll tell is that expensive , complicated decisions -- it 's not easy , that they do n't help .
they do n't actually hurt .
you care for that we got worse , standing there .
if something from what the human society will enable your decisions to meet to the societies in which people of a variety 've shifted their dignity , would not only does life of people struggling , but our brains would also be improved .
economists call this one <unk> <unk> .
<unk> will be worried that it 's everybody gets -- not just the poor -- because all these large selection of us <unk> .
finally , reading your this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , ah ! what you know this fish ?
you know it not possible in this <unk> .
<unk> fantasy , a shortsighted , from the world -- and that 's the way i got to the first i 've read .
the greater i do out-of-the-box thinking about , the more i came to of view , that the fish , you know .
because the truth is , if you that <unk> break , that anything is possible , they have no freedom . they have that paralysis within .
if you that <unk> break , that anything is possible to reduce her the average happiness .
they 're stepping out of paralysis and reduce the average happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost to <unk> security to be limited -- perhaps even for the fish , definitely upward for us .
but that <unk> be by a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for the misery , and , i suspect , disaster .
tr : thank you .
you know , i talked about some of these projects are already been talked to this about human genome , and that could mean , and over the discovery of new view of genes .
actually start to by a new point : we have the biology and digitized , and now we try the digital code in a new phase of biology to go by we new life forms and build .
we 've always trying to great questions to ask .
what 's life ? it 's something , what i believe that many biologists have tried to understand and that has a different levels .
we have different approaches tried to it up on the minimal components to simplify them .
we have nearly 20 years of digitized . when we do this <unk> have sequenced <unk> at the transition from the analog world of biology to digital world of the computer .
now we 're trying to ask whether we live regenerate , or whether we new life create , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , the mycoplasma <unk> , of that 's smallest genome was a species has the yourself in the lab that replicate it can . and we tried to see if we do this with a little bit smaller genome to achieve .
we 've done it on about a hundred genes to get rid of the 500 dollars or so , who are here .
but if we have those metabolic map to look at the very simple is , relative to our . you can trust me , this is straightforward . but if we have all those genes look at the we 're one after another eliminate can it 's very unlikely that this is a living cell driving down .
so we decided to that 's the only way forward is the the chromosome in fact , to synthesize , which allows us to the length of components to <unk> and thus , some of those fundamental issues to ask .
and so we started with the question , we can a chromosome , synthesize that ?
it 's allowed the chemistry that really big molecule to make them , what had never before we made it ?
and to talk about that can , we can that chromosome start ?
a chromosome is the way , just a piece <unk> chemical material .
our actions at the digitization , the way we were growing exponentially .
our ability of genetic code to write it comes to be evolving very slowly but nevertheless , increasing . and our final point would go on an exponential curve to set .
we 've got 15 years ago i started .
it took actually a few years , starting with a <unk> review , before we the first experiments that made .
as it turns out is <unk> very difficult .
there are tens of machine around the world 's the little pieces of dna can manufacture , 30 to 50 letters about , but it 's a <unk> process , as any longer you a piece of power , the more fatal mistake to happen .
so we had a new approaches tried to do we kind of these little pieces together and the error correct way .

it 's a virus of bacteria is killing .
so we made a little pieces , making an <unk> and had a dna molecule of approximately 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase , came when we this piece <unk> chemical in reasonable and a bacterium , gave me , and this bacterium , transforming the genetic code to read and went viral particles .
the viral particle charges were then by the cells <unk> and they came back and killing e. coli .
recently i did with the <unk> spoken and they 're looking at this model just <unk> .
they were laughing , more than their it here does this .
so we think that 's a situation is in the software in fact that your hardware to build in a biological systems .
but we wanted more continue to go we wanted an entire <unk> chromosome , building . it has over <unk> letter of genetic code . so we thought of us , we build it <unk> size of the virus of thing that we the size of <unk> <unk> able to understand what the length of components of a living cell phones are .
design is the key , and if you 're using digital information in the computer to start to have these digital access information , really <unk> be .
when we do this genome we first in 1995 , have sequenced it was the <unk> an error , per 10,000 base pairs .
we found at <unk> 30 mistakes . if we the <unk> sequence is used to it would never been able <unk> .
part of the design is it cut to create the 50 letters to go and the with other <unk> pieces <unk> need to get smaller <unk> to build these things fit .
we have a unique features here 's built .
so you 've heard that we <unk> built into that .
just think about : we have a <unk> code : b , c , g and t .
<unk> these letters -- these letters actually encode about 20 amino acids , and here 's a single <unk> for each of these amino acids .
so we can the genetic code using to our words to write , sentences , thoughts .
initially we only signed .
some people who was disappointed about that 's not bad poetry was .
we have the pieces of your engineered that we 'll just with enzymes break away . there are enzymes are the this repair and again <unk> .
and we 've started pieces to create , starting with pieces of <unk> to <unk> letters <unk> , added these <unk> to <unk> to get back to self-assemble , to <unk> .
in every step we have these pieces in the surplus for producing to sequence them were able to because we tried a very robust that process to create what they were in a minute you will see .
we tried to point of <unk> to go .
so , that looks like a <unk> .

we knew from a mechanism of <unk> <unk> 's called , the the biology is used to dna to fix that those pieces <unk> can .
here 's an example of them . there 's an organism is called <unk> <unk> of three million ] bike at the light that survived .
you see in the upper field to be a chromosome , cut apart , drops .
to about 12 , 24 hours later , i did all over again , brought it was like .
we have thousands of organisms that can do .
these organisms that can totally <unk> going to you can even in the vacuum life .
i 'm totally certain that live in space , and move to be able to search of <unk> conditions .
in fact , the nasa has shown that 's lots of them out there are .
here 's a <unk> of the molecule that we 've created by we these redundant processes have used -- actually we only <unk> used to the right design of pieces , we do <unk> . yeast <unk> these then automatically join .
this is not <unk> it 's a regular micrograph .
it 's a big molecule that we do it even with the <unk> can see .
now that 's about a whole duration of six seconds .

that are about <unk> letters to <unk> code . it is that 's largest molecule , <unk> structure that ever of people who was created .
it has a <unk> from over 300 million .

now how to start to a chromosome out ? how we activate it ?
obviously is that 's a virus , very simple is it 's much more complicated with bacteria to deal .
it 's also simpler , and if it <unk> how we there are doing : you just take the nucleus out and there is another into it , and that 's exactly what they all about this is cloning , you 've heard .
at <unk> is that chromosome into the cell , integration , but recently , we have shown that you have a complete the transplant a chromosome from one cell to another change it can , and things activate the way .
we <unk> that chromosome one <unk> . roughly these two far apart from away as humans , mice . we gave some <unk> encourages us to the the chromosome choose our way . we <unk> 's enzymes are about the proteins to destroy . and it was very amazing when we , it 's a cell on the body -- and they 're going to our very <unk> graphics and here we estimate --
this new synthetic chromosome out went into the cell .
indeed we thought that this is the end is , but we tried to the process will continue to bring .
this is the <unk> of evolution , here .
we find all kinds of species here the a second chromosome we recorded them or a third of <unk> , every time , thousands of the characteristics in just a second to a species <unk> .
people so , who get evolution , but as a gene that a moment changed to have a lot of biology missed .
there are enzymes are the <unk> 're called the fact , dna and digest .
that chromosome , that the cell was that none of the chromosomes , which we added to have already .
it was in the cell <unk> and i realized that other synthetic chromosome into a foreign material <unk> it , and we had the end just a cell with a new synthetic chromosome .
it <unk> moving blue , because of genes that we added up .

all these proteins to vd at the membranes vd and grew up -- when we the genetic code , you read , it that 's exactly what we <unk> have .
it may get personal genomic <unk> sound , but we can , we the <unk> shift , things quite dramatic change .
now i argues that do n't the <unk> is -- this is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution
and i argues that we may have you 're a new the cambrian explosion to create in the it 's massive new <unk> based on the digital media design might be .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty obvious in terms of what we need .

about it into my connection to ask : i went back in 1946 , born .
today are three people on planet every one of it was in 1946 have been hurting were capable of 40 years will it 's four be .
we have problems with the foods , with <unk> and clean water , medicine , the fuel for a half billion people .
it 's a challenge that for nine to offer .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion <unk> oil . that are a hundred million <unk> a day .
if we 're biological processes are thinking or any process to bring that replace , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there 's that all the co2 from in this is this the atmosphere , lands .
we have now , from our discoveries from around the world , a database , about 20 million of genes , and i believe that the <unk> the future are .
the <unk> had a dozen other components , and look at the diversity , at the came out .
we hit here , primarily on the boundary of biological reality and they 're holding on our imagination .
we 've now technologies , because of this rapid <unk> , to do that what we <unk> genetics call .
we have now , the ability to a big robots to build of millions of chromosomes , a day they make it can .
if you imagine those 20 million people different genes , make or these redundant processes to optimize the octane fuel , make or drugs new vaccines , we can do with a few small team over <unk> change as the last 20 years of science .
and it 's just <unk> selection . we can take <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> and forth .
this is a shot of cartoon <unk> at the we work , with the you actually sit and new species at the computers were designing <unk>
you know , we do n't exactly how it will look . we know exactly how their genetic code will look .
we focus and let 's the fossil fuels the fourth generation .
they have recently , corn , making ethanol seen what 's just a bad tv experiment is .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation of relatively soon emerge from the much higher <unk> have become , how octane fuel or different kinds of <unk> .
but , how we think , the only way to biology is a big impact , no further increase the cost of food or the limitation of their availability that , which is , if we added co2 as starting to see , and therefore we 're working on cells that those away ,
and we think that we the first with <unk> the fourth generation will be , and that 's about 18 months .
the sunlight and co2 are a method --

this is an organism on the we 1996 , described it .
he lives in the deep , about <unk> miles deep , at virtually <unk> <unk> .
it converts co2 in the methane to sort of use of hydrogen , <unk> .
we can study whether we <unk> co2 we can use , which simply to <unk> brought to be able to <unk> this co2 in the fuel cell to this process , power .
within a short , we believe , we could in the be able to one of basic questions of life to solve .
you know , we really -- <unk> goals , like the nutritional substitute for all of the petrochemical industry . exactly when you do n't that could do , where else ? a <unk> of energy to be .
but as we work currently starting to the same two approaches , for development of vaccines , use .
they 've got this year with the flu , seen , we 're always a year precisely backwards now , and have a dollar a little bit , if it around the right <unk> go .
i think that changed to be using you <unk> vaccines , <unk> created .
that 's like the future may just might be with changes , can now the <unk> sped up being with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> .
we are light years of you remove humans to improve . our goal is being merely to be a chance to have long enough to survive to that potentially to do . thank you !
the last ted conference room gave me an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised you back to come to explain how the machine works .
now , it 's so far . and for all those who did n't there were , the lhc is that 's largest scientific fact , which you 've actually addressed by -- 27 billion miles in diameter .
his job is it 's the conditions to create , which fewer than a <unk> second , after the beginning of the universe already existed -- and this to 600 million times within a second .
it 's just the breathtaking , ambitious .
this is the machine , above , from in geneva .
we 're taking pictures of <unk> in the detectors on .
at this , i work . he calls himself atlas of the detector , a 44 feet in the width , 22 feet in diameter .
here 's a spectacular picture of an atlas off in the construction , lest you the <unk> see .
10th , . september last year off the machine first time on .
and this slide done by reference atlas of recorded .

it 's a picture of the first <unk> which the route around the lhc <unk> , then we intentionally off with a part of the lhc <unk> , to inspire by high-energy particles at the detector <unk> to leave .
in other words , when we have this picture of 10 . september one , we knew that the machine works , a huge victory is .
i do n't know , whether this the biggest <unk> generated , or this , when someone who google site went and the front page as i found .
it means that we have a cultural , apart from ernst reached .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine do with these <unk> here to do had -- this golden wires , here .
those wires , guiding <unk> <unk> if the machine on <unk> running .
now the engineers do you , when you look and no , that they 're not that are little piano wires .
can do this country , because if you very far <unk> , you 're going to call <unk> .
at minus <unk> degrees , so , cooler than the space between the stars , can actually wires in the tension and endurance .
in one of new connections between about <unk> magnet inside the lhc , there was a <unk> .
this makes <unk> at the wires , slightly and <unk> <unk> met and suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was that .
now this is still <unk> if you imagine that the magnets used over 20 tons weigh up and about . 30 inches , shifted .
we <unk> so about 50 of a magnet
and they had to remove , we also did .
we <unk> them based <unk> you .
you , they 're all over again on their way back .
end of the march , the lhc switches back <unk> be .


i think the fact that 's such is , the fact that we about our barriers , beyond our grasp , forming the value of things like the lhc .

thank you .
i 'm a writer .
to write books is my profession , but it 's certainly more than that .
it 's also my lifetime of love and fascination .
and i do n't expect that does it ever set up .
however , is the recent something weird in my life and my career has happened , that made me has brought to my reference to this work full to revisit .

this result is that i , you anywhere , i come to treat people ask when i would have the <unk> <unk> .
seriously -- which <unk> <unk> it !
for example , they 're very concerned up to me , but fear does n't that they do this success never by 2027 be ?
they have no fear that your whole life <unk> and never again a book to create , that <unk> in the world 's what interests ? never again ? ''
okay , that 's really go .
it would end that 's worse , when i 'm not remind myself , that i over 20 years ago , when i was a teenager i first of them told that i writer , who wanted to be , with the same kind of <unk> response been faced in .
the people said , <unk> you no fear , never succeed , to have ?
you have no fear that you the humiliation of rejection killing ?
you have no fear that you take on the craft , your life to <unk> and it will never happened , and that you 're going to a <unk> <unk> dreams are dying , going -- your mouth is filled with the bitter ashes at the failure ? ''
so , you know .
the answer -- the short answer on these questions is <unk>
yes , i 'm afraid of those things .
and that i had always .
and i 've got a lot more things not fearful , which nobody <unk> would .
how the algae -- and other <unk> things .
but , if it counts , writing about and i have been recently , about and wonder : why ?

it 's obvious that by somebody 's expected to be that he was in fear has to the work to do to the warm up professions feel ?
and what exactly what is with the creative <unk> go , you for us , i 'm going to move beyond <unk> make -- in a kind of how it other professions have n't do ?
my father , for example , chemist and i can look at me any situation in his dream 40 years as a chemist , remember , the he was asked , if he feared would have , chemist to be .
with your <unk> , john -- how it 's telling ?
it did n't think you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of a chemist who have about the centuries , not the reputation of <unk> <unk> people sustain .
we author who seem , but this kind of noise band to have not just the writer , but the creative in all of genres of streaming down this reputation to have , mentally freak unstable , to be .
all have to do , is , at the bitter <unk> of really great minds , by himself from the 20th century . watch , the young and a lot of my own hand , died .
and even the ones that are not actually <unk> <unk> , the tracks from their talent , neglected and bred to be .
norman <unk> said , just before he died in his last job interview this <unk> my books , i got a little more <unk>
an extraordinary statement that they do you <unk> do this .
but we shrug n't even , if we want to do n't tell you hear , because we sort of statements for such a long time that you know . somehow we have the notion that <unk> and collective , acceptable , that creativity and suffering , kind of course <unk> and that art -- end -- being able to <unk> .
the question that i do today wish everyone here to ask you 'd like this is this idea , they messed up in all right ?
they feel to guess ? because with only one inch by looking at any , i feel with this notion that 's not comfortable .
i think they <unk> .
and i think they 're dangerous . and i 'm not watching , how do next century taken up .
i think it 's better , if we have a big creative encourage to live .
and i know definitely think it for me -- in my medical situation -- very dangerous would be able to start , this dark path of a conjecture sort <unk> -- especially in the <unk> , which i 'm interested in my career working on the <unk> .
this means -- look : i 'm very young . i 'm just ca . 40 years old .
i may yet another 40 <unk> to me .
and it 's extremely unlikely that everything , i from now on writing , i 'm going out of the world as the work <unk> going to the after the <unk> success of my last book came , right ?
i say it comes straight , because we 're here 's right now all sort of friends -- it 's highly unlikely that my greatest success , behind me that lies .
oh , jesus , for a thought it !
that are sort of the thoughts that anyone can cause to 9 a.m start , <unk> to drink . and that i want to do n't .
i would prefer to continue this work to do , which i love .
so is the question : how ?
after a while the <unk> strikes me that i had to continue to write your , a kind of <unk> psychological <unk> design must .
somehow i want to take from now on out a way , while typing a safe distance to act between me and my very natural <unk> about how the reaction towards this <unk> will be .
while i was in the past year after the models for looking to college , to do that , i also the past that were seeking and i tried to other societies have to find to see if you might better or <unk> ideas about it had when we , , how creativity can help , with the emotional risks to deal , who creativity are connected .
this quest that led me to the ancient greece and this ancient rome .
please join them to me , because the circle goes back to close .
but in ancient greece and rome people do n't really believed that creativity of people coming , okay ?
they believed that creativity is a kind <unk> <unk> was , the from a distant , a source to the people coming -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this kind of divinity <unk> of creativity <unk> .
from socrates stated that is known that he 's really believed , he would have a <unk> , of him <unk> out on the distance , i delivered .
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative spirit of <unk> .

they believed that 's a genius , like this magical <unk> beings there was , which did was that 's literally in the walls of a <unk> lives -- about as <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artists to work of kind of the invisible <unk> and this result of work involves designing their dignity .
that 's brilliant -- there 's got there 's the distance , of i talked about that kind of psychological <unk> , the way of the following your work to protect .
and everybody knew that 's kind of worked , right ?
the artists , the <unk> was a certain things are protected for instance , too much <unk> , right ?
if your work , brilliant was <unk> you 're not all look for you <unk> . everybody knew that you this <unk> genius , until this , that you helped build it .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely off your mistakes , right ?
and everybody knew your genius did something <unk> .
so people a lot of the west really long time about creativity thought .
and then came the renaissance and all changed by themselves . we had this great idea . and this great idea was : let 's this is happening with individual needs to the center of the universe is -- about all the gods and mystery . and there 's no room , more for mystical creatures , the commands by the divine accept .
it 's the beginning of the rational humanism , and the people started to believe that creativity is completely different from their own individual coming .
first time in history of you can hear people were , or those artist 's a genius call -- instead of that he 's a genius did .
i have to tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a sensation merely a person to allow that he thinks , he or you know how this <unk> , like this pelvis and the essence , and the root of all of divinity , creative , <unk> of never-ending that mystery is a little bit too much responsibility to do a <unk> , human psyche <unk> .
it 's how someone to ask , the sun to swallow .

i think that this <unk> our artists of the last 500 years only blew up .
and , if this right -- and i think it 's true -- is the question
we can be able to change ?
maybe a <unk> understanding about the relationship between humans and the mystery of creative ways to return .
maybe not .
maybe we can that <unk> from 500 years , rational humanism not just a <unk> talk to eradicate poverty .
and there 's sure people in this audience , who really <unk> basically concerned register anything about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , the people <unk> and <unk> on their projects , etc . apply them .
i 'll probably not all of them up to voyage to do .
but the question that i left posing want is why not ?
why not think about ?
because it 's as much sense like everything else , which i 've heard , if it was never about that completely off <unk> <unk> the creative process to explain .


i had recently , such an encounter , when i the extraordinary american beat poet , <unk> stone , i met , the well over 90 is that , but the whole life for a poet , was . they told me that you when the <unk> virginia , growing out the fields , working on . she said , they would feel and you can hear like a poem written about the landscape on them <unk> .
she said it would like a <unk> train from air ,
of about this country on them <unk> would .
they felt , if it came , because it would the planet among their feet to <unk> bring .
they knew that they 're going to a given moment , only one could do . and this was -- in her words -- <unk> like the <unk> .
they ran out of the world heading towards the house while you from this poem that tracks was . it was breaking point that she quickly enough to a paper and a pencil for storm had to make them to keep it through them through <unk> to catch up on the blank document i could .


so : she runs off the house and so after the paper and this poem goes through them through and she reaches a pen , just as it through them <unk> and then -- she said -- it was so i 'd been working with their other hand , then we can pick up to package of wars .
they <unk> this poem in its tail and pulled it back in your body and it 's took on this paper .
at these opportunities that came this poem <unk> and intact and on paper on -- but it backwards -- from last word to the first .

this is n't like my creative process -- i 'm not the channel . ''
i 'm a <unk> . to work to do i have a day and the same time up , and sweat to me <unk> and really , awkward <unk> .
but even i in my <unk> 've sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess that many of them that neither did .
even i had to work or ideas , who came from a source of me <unk> that i did n't identify you can .
what is that for a thing ?

for me this is best of living example , , how to create a bunch of musicians and tom <unk> . i was not allowed him a few years ago for a magazine interview .
we did n't think about the issue . and you know what the most of time of his life was tom opens the embodiment of the <unk> modern artist , of trying to <unk> creative impulses that in him <unk> , to master and you <unk> .
but then he was the older and quiet . he told me that 's one day on a <unk> in los angeles to get off . and there 's changed to everything for him .
he drove up with high speeds , when he suddenly left a fragment of a tune to hear that , how it at my inspirations are often is , for him <unk> hard fingertips , and it 's and he wants you have them is gorgeous . he <unk> afterwards , but he does n't know how to go .
he has no paper , has n't a pen , it has n't <unk> .
he starts so , these old <unk> in him to level-up , like . therefore i 'm going to this thing to lose and i 'm going from this song on forever tracks you 're going .
i 'm not good enough , i 'm able to do it <unk>
but rather than in to panic can run , he heard just on .
he ended the whole <unk> and doing something completely new .
he looked up to heaven and said <unk> , you ca n't see that i drive to drive ? ''
<unk> i like this as i could just a song write it ?
if you really exist want to come to a <unk> moment , again , when i 'm going to your mind can .
if not <unk> today , someone else .
go and <unk> leonard <unk>


but the process and the heavy <unk> , the way around , salvaged when he was this kind of a genius , it turns out the eighth , where he 's nothing more trouble was making and it is where <unk> where he sort , came from . he realized that 's no <unk> , <unk> thing to be gone .
it would build a <unk> , some miraculous , bizarre things to be some kind of a conversation with tom , and the <unk> , <unk> does n't know tom was .
when i this story i 've heard that changed it also a bit of the way , as i worked and it 's got myself been through this promise .
this idea that saved me when i in the middle <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> was . i fell into this <unk> the <unk> in that we 're going to fall , if we 're doing things work and it works . you <unk> to think that 's a disaster will this is that 's worst possible book , that it was written .
not just bad , but the worst of all times .
i started to think , i do this project , just <unk> .
but then i remembered that i remember , like tom in the free for heaven , talking had and i tried it .
i picked up my view from the manuscript , and talked my blog commentary , in towards an empty the edge of the room .
i spoke to the best : <unk> to , you you and i know each instance , if this book , not brilliant , is that 's not complete my fault , is , right ?
because you ought to know that i do everything , i , <unk> . i no longer than that .
if you give it better have you want to you have got here <unk> and your percentage of the deal <unk> .
okay , but , if you do n't that you doing ... you know what , then to screw up .
i 'm still continues to write , because this my job .
and i want to ask you protocol , add that i do today for my portion of the jobs here <unk>
because ‚Äî ‚Äî at it 's like this . centuries ago , got together in the deserts <unk> people to <unk> with the sacred dances , and music , gathered , the long hours ceremony has been -- to <unk> .
those solid things were always been great , because the great dancers were a professional and they were fantastic .
but , and go back , very rare , what happened was something special . one of the performer , was actually <unk> .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that they all in your life has been such a <unk> have seen .

and sudden , it seemed he 's no longer just put in human .
he was from the inside lights up and from below lights up and everything is lit up through a <unk> fire .
as something like this time , what happened , we knew the people what that was . they called it at his name .
they laid the hands together and began to sing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god <unk>
this is god , you know ?


and that 's great , because we need that .
but , the tricky part of the following the next morning , if the dancer who wakes up and recognizes that 's 11 o'clock at a tuesday -- is -- and he 's no longer a <unk> of god who wears it .

and maybe will never again , if god 's name of calls , you spin . but what he then with the life begin ?
that 's hard .
this is one of <unk> <unk> a creative life .


if we start to think about , changes all this .
so i began to think , and i think with safety in the past few months , while i 'm going on the book working , that will appear to -- as the most dangerous , <unk> to be expected <unk> my <unk> success .
what i 'm looking constantly to tell you have , if i think about this crazy going to this job is no fear .
does n't <unk> .
i do n't put your job .
they continue for your contribution to , whatever he would be <unk> .
if your job that dance is , <unk> .
if you that stupid divine genius , that gave me aside and they ask is to decide , for a short moment a <unk> by miracles through your efforts to show , then <unk> it ! ''
and if not <unk> still do dance .
and <unk> it ! '' for you , despite all .
i believe , and i feel like this , we should that teach .
<unk> it ! '' for you , despite all , just do you to the mere human universal love and the <unk> hey , for it 's going to be .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> it !
last year , i these slides , shown to illustrate that the <unk> <unk> , the for nearly three million years of the size of the bottom forty-eight states had to 40 percent of it shrunk is .
but this blasts down , not enough to the seriousness , this particular problem of , there 's not the thickness of ice data .
in certain ambiguity is the <unk> <unk> that beating heart of our global <unk> .
she grows in winter and <unk> in summer .
the next slide that i show you , is a <unk> what the last 25 years is happening .
this <unk> is with the red them .
as you see growing up on this <unk> tagged iraq . this is the annual ice in the wintertime ; and it <unk> in summer .
this so-called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which the body , here <unk> .
in 25 years , it will of this up here to be gone .
this is a problem , there the warming the frozen reason to the arctic ocean <unk> , which is a large amounts of a <unk> carbon out of that that , when he <unk> , of microbes , methane and implemented it will .
comparing with the total amount of <unk> <unk> in the atmosphere , and figure out of these huge amount of double , if we find that critical point the boundaries .
already today <unk> in some of shallow lakes in alaska , methane from ourselves from the water .
professor <unk> walter , the university in alaska 's with another task force to a different shallow seas last winter i entered .
wow !
you know it goes well , the question is , how it gets us <unk> .


but the volume , are far bigger than ever .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you want to know , like the sea through <unk> up here <unk> them to sea .
those rivers , rapidly up .
other end of the planet , the antarctic , the biggest <unk> the planet .
last month had signed the researchers that the entire continent now a negative <unk> it .
and the <unk> , the about a couple <unk> showed is , is particularly powerful in the melting .
this fits within 20 feet <unk> , like the greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , look up in lakes , the a few years ago , the glaciers were .
forty percent of people in the world , we get half its <unk> from this <unk> .
in the andes , is this glacier , the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have to <unk> .
but if you <unk> , will also that the drinking <unk> .
in california was a 40 <unk> reduction of <unk> the sierra seen .
this mechanism affecting the <unk> .
and the predictions , as you read it , are seriously .
these <unk> in the whole world that leads to a dramatic improvement on fire .
and the catastrophe , around the world have in a really <unk> and before , unprecedented <unk> increased .
four times as a lot of the last 30 years , like in the <unk> 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you do in the historical record amounts of view , they can see , it <unk> .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons to co2 produced all of 24 hours -- 25 million tons daily in the oceans .
look at the domain of the eastern pacific , right up , the american continent <unk> and <unk> the indian <unk> , where it 's a <unk> decrease its oxygen in the ocean there .
the biggest single factor for the global warming , next to deforestation , which gives 20 percent of life , is that burn off fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is that 's nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states are one of those two largest <unk> , together , .
and the suggestion was , many other <unk> to build .
but we start to a shift to see .
here are the , the and in the last painted by , with some green are alternatives , the u.s. state .

and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> dollars last <unk> spent to clean coal to promote , we 're already a contradiction in itself is .
this picture was reminded me on anything .
the christmas around and ran to me to home in tennessee , a billion tons <unk> out .
they have it <unk> in the news ever seen .
this is in our nation of <unk> <unk> america .
this happened on christmas .
one of ads , the <unk> on christmas lights off this .
<unk> of <unk> is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
it 's in an envelope and wealth in america , and he helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> going to every day , clean .
he is affordable , and <unk> , and the workers stop in <unk> and this bread .
this is the source of the most of coal in virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the director of massey <unk> .
let me just a very clearly tell al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they do n't know , what they talk .
so the alliance for <unk> two campaigns to live launched this .
this is a part of her .
at the <unk> we can see the climate as a serious at risk for our business .
why we 've got us to the supreme <unk> every now , a significant <unk> spend a <unk> on the way to bring to the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal is n't really messy .
and we think she 's clean -- and it smells are also really good .
so , it does n't worry about the climate .
leave you know that was quiet for us .
<unk> coal , they have a lot about it .
so let 's just a tour of modern , clean <unk> do .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it 's the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet this burning of coal , one of the main reasons for the global warming is , the coolest in clean <unk> that you see here , changes everything .
look at it right up , this is the sum today , clean <unk> .
finally , mash up the positive alternative to our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the major thread , of these all together , is our dependence upon <unk> <unk> like the dirty and coal and <unk> oil .
but now there 's a courageous , new fundraising , around us from this <unk> able to be free .
<unk> america to 100 percent cleaner , electricity , new , within the next 10 years .
a plan , america , back to work to bring to us safer place to make and to help , the global warming , to stop .
finally , a solution that 's large enough , our to solve problems .
<unk> america , new . they find more unified systems .
this is the last thing .
this is about a <unk> of america .

the future is here . wind the sun , and a new <unk> .
so more investment to be paid for jobs to create .
<unk> america , new . it 's time , reality to accept .
there 's an african proverb that if you could be you want to go alone .
if you go so far you want to go together .
we need to come and it quickly .
thank you .
i want to start to ask them , at the time your childhood <unk> , when you with <unk> playing .

that 's spacial think is intimately involved with linked to fit a lot of our environment to understand .
when <unk> -- inspired by the kind of our minds interacting with physical objects -- pictured with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> <unk> , i began to wonder : what would happen if we use computers would that instead of a <unk> , of yourself as a digital <unk> on a shallow tie these moves ... ... what if some of , we both hands to intervene to implement and data , physically , taking and they organize able to fit it want ?

the short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can start with the hand , if you know , you might remind each perceive , you can its motion capture and they have a screen and a <unk> .
more important : these are physically for why you understand how <unk> merely by that stick out of hands and access to move the way .
and the <unk> for example of a new generation of <unk> to the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools <unk> going and a consciousness for your movement to develop , at each individual and the intricacies of our <unk> with you can perceive , then we can share with the explorers in new and <unk> <unk> start .
i start with some simple design examples up .
this <unk> is , for <unk> <unk> and if i asked him in a direction <unk> , which is that drives played back ; if i asked him in the other <unk> , where it backwards .
and this interactive for portraits of taking off each true .
if i do so , side put on , lights that their interest .
if you <unk> are surrounded , notice that 's what they also , and you can be nervous , you .
and they feel as their movements and the propensity .
an interesting result of interactions , which we to see that we started , that we are everyday gestures on data from there could , like the colors , like to <unk> , , how do with <unk> does this .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> and i can you use to paint in the in the center to <unk> , where they then mixed it will .
if we it might overdo it , we can be a little <unk> .


this is a game with words , but this kind of the mix of <unk> and <unk> is .

then , after about 30 seconds , will get mixed and has a new <unk> and new ways to explore this .
thank you .
that are some kids who on an outing of for the media lab and lake . i could do we move to try it and i 've got a video that included .
they have it really loved .
an interesting <unk> at this kind of applications is that , the people not a lot of instruction , there must .
all you have it 's formed in words , '' and you know exactly what to do is .
here are still a few people out of testing .
this is our youngest <unk> down the right .
it turns out that he 's the <unk> just a pile them wanted .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted a <unk> for <unk> develop .
this is <unk> .
he can create new characters in the scene from them , by the <unk> the <unk> , of those figure shows .
here 's let 's the sun <unk> .
the sun goes on
now speeding up a <unk> in the scene .

good work , `` aye .
by the <unk> shake and them side of them , he can the characters are interacting by ...
... his own story to make up .
hello !

flying his cat .
this last example , for that i want to college , it 's showing is a <unk> for <unk> , that recently we 've developed and the <unk> as a sound , how <unk> , and bass , and the drums , they act .
each has four different variations , you can choose , which you wants to use .
and you can do this sounds in the sequence , putting , who bring in every possible for patterns organize it can .
and <unk> you a , you just a <unk> a <unk> holding .
there are the effects , who live , we can change , like . hall and filter .

and then , <unk> effects , like this pace , and the volume , who on the entire sequence of exercise .
so we have a look .
we start , which we are the <unk> in two <unk> putting and this in a series organize , they expand and a little bit more voice of adding positives .
now <unk> i was a bass , added .
now i 'll do something like drums , to do .
and now <unk> i the filters out with the drums , i could have the effect of live by .
i can the entire sequence or speed , i found that rate in one or other direction <unk> .
and now <unk> i the filter , with the bass , for something more terrified .
i can the sequence , while they 're headed <unk> .

and finally , i can the entire sequence <unk> , i the <unk> left <unk> .
thank you .
so as you can see , because my desire to this new <unk> to develop , the better to the fit , like our brains and bodies to work .
and today , i had time , you a part of these new <unk> and some of ways by showing you believe , that our lab to work .
the idea , the i 'm happy to the way to give you want , is that we 're the door to this new generation of <unk> to interact with digital media as the world , the information in our world to bring that our demands is equal .
thank you ,
i 'm pleased to the talks with you all right !
