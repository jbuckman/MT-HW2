yes , good day , ladies , gentlemen .
well thank you , for inviting me here today to talk .
and i got right now , ourselves to imagine .
my name is christian <unk> and i am , weird that term , <unk> at the city of food .
that are called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : one personnel to the second organization , and thirdly , the public policy .
so i 'm for the <unk> this city , well .
and it makes you 're not very popular .
i know .
and moreover , and this is what my son , particularly liked it , i also <unk> .
that means that i 'm the head of <unk> department .
<unk> <unk> and a kilometer <unk> .
and you have i was thinking of course is a subject matter , i do today <unk> want .
you know , and the topic <unk> , because that belongs to the firemen .

you know him .
he was just look at general <unk> .
and then i 'm starting to do n't very serious enough to say .
i <unk> you a position .
so we speak , if it sort of a risk , there was that the brink of a disaster stand for example , <unk> <unk> , the rush .
so many people are traveling .
it is pushing up , it <unk> themselves .

nobody seems to belong .
the suitcase heard any subject .
suddenly an <unk> .
leave you that <unk> .
the police comes to fire department , <unk> .
people call .
officials <unk> .
they go out .
what 's because matter ? to ask <unk> .
we realize that we 're not or we ca n't it 's say .
the people leave this building .
kids to cry .
you fall even maybe , because it all very quickly go forward .
suddenly assumes one of gossip .
there 's <unk> inside .
a panic for breaking out .
i hear now here on .
the rest <unk> i your imagination .
but it 's no fantasy , that i <unk> did . <unk> ?
that is happening in this week is happening in <unk> .
there 's a such a suitcase can lie has remained .
later turned out there 's just , <unk> , nine kilogram of drugs and there were .
but the people were just , and so a friend mine that tells , from the building <unk> .
it was nothing i said .
and there was that same kind of gossip were looking at least in the group at that my friend of in my friend who ended up .
thank god is n't panic <unk> , otherwise would this whole other pressures not safe breaking out how it seems .
you see in a <unk> , a <unk> disaster is it gives a very important right .

you know what 's because we go .
the past the good , old any time that for the authorities did n't quite simple .
we just have nothing i said , or we 've got lied .
why ?
because the so-called <unk> ruled .

this is in an era of social media , in an era of twitter in an era of facebook , in an era of private and public <unk> , in an era of <unk> and public television , as possible .


the first <unk> about it arrived at twitter .

this was no <unk> .

because most of course , we 're also the past , the supposedly , the truth know , because we as the agency , to needless to pay attention , that we just <unk> information can pass .
remember we are public media -- well , private sector emerging media , either are very high school or they do it just not .
by therefore , we 're going to eat and that 's also something that has been through the media has gone are , to think about how we 're in the future with <unk> deal .
and to do we 're going to the good old <unk> back to retrieve them .
however , just as a of <unk> .
this means we 're in the next 20 years to about <unk> in the <unk> build that , some of you know that again , <unk> , if it just to <unk> coming .
once it was involved .
they may know you know yet , three times just let 's just as long , and once , which means .
i know it 's no longer .
we 're going to do that today <unk> with all <unk> that we 're doing this is about when you have , <unk> , via facebook , from twitter , about that radio <unk> too late night , about that television and at all about blogs that and the local media and forth and immediately , connected course , we have to <unk> to end of information forward to get .
and we know what we must be very quickly and <unk> operate and we need to be very quickly and <unk> creed , because the <unk> and citizens to be otherwise <unk> .
and that ultimately have n't think this , we say , to .
communication in the crisis , or in the disaster is so one hand , a question of <unk> about all media , the to apply to , and it 's also a question of its credibility .
the credibility that 's our biggest problem , because the <unk> and citizens to say , either , oh , the proportion , once again , which is none , or they say the <unk> us , it 's anything worse than it 's actually .
we have therefore , too bad experiences has done with facebook and twitter , more recently .
well that you may have some of in them on the media are taken .
we have a major <unk> to eat <unk> had .
and it 's a so-called chemical bomb .
that are bombs that with a <unk> equipped them are , because the least once did n't look at the first <unk> on <unk> explode , but through their homes in war ii <unk> and just at the ground , because of a chemical response , which triggered by that is a little bit of metal plate , the <unk> <unk> two <unk> from each separated , who <unk> , and then came up to the explosion .
this problem is just , many of the suitcase bombs 've never works and so after the way back in <unk> the things to eat <unk> .
and there were going from an elderly gentleman , of his own conscience , how he so beautiful in the scientific protocol , said , <unk> wanted , we were now , he had seen as you <unk> forty-three favor , is , and now <unk> got the regulators are getting informed that 's a bomb go ahead . laughter in the background
the way since they get into the elderly gentleman reported in the whole <unk> .
we 're seeing what we 'll find everything .


and saw in history of the city of the communication cables from facebook and twitter could run with the implication that the entire <unk> far above <unk> <unk> total of been following .
and the media is very excited . laughter in the background .
we had n't even with some of telephony , but who have <unk> and <unk> , all over <unk> and twitter .

just run , they have to me also a little symbols give , when i stop the event .
i can go from here 's not at the watch the window .
this is the credibility that makes me , because the first of these social media , the advantage we have to do is very much information can pass .
not very <unk> are , because the members who are tweeting or the <unk> , , how she calls , a high <unk> have .
secondly , rapid <unk> .
if anything not true , writes that someone who immediately , so the credibility that , of that i 've talked about , which goes up , because the area of the entire community together basically to the raised hands are involved in this is .
and it 's a very high <unk> therefore , if anything that 's wrong , then it can also very quickly <unk> be .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> that this is exciting found , as a bomb , <unk> park in high go .
by so we 've got all the things that in the last happen now , and there are much more <unk> happens when <unk> a really thinking , as <unk> one knows .
well , the city may eat per day of such a disaster home and looking to be .
a bomb , the in implode , you have in a park , it 's certainly not such a .
but they can also , and even after <unk> we now , in <unk> found in , and then i 'm going up with our <unk> and try to the in seven meters of the depth <unk> .
and if the , so you think munich , you think about the other cities , if the will implode , you have , because they send a so-called <unk> has to take conventional or not to defuse that can , then we know , right now , become a variety of houses that wo n't look like before .
and this to communicate is very important one hand , because it just in one in a world <unk> <unk> rate is necessary , communication to run by which you may panic to prevent to do n't worry about to wear , people to be informed us to get to do n't worry about to carry that the people of are able to move on these difficult situation work .
and the social media to help us too cold , <unk> to be , because ultimately , they 're all of communications are involved , and it 's not just <unk> <unk> is how we that the <unk> , <unk> and certainly been before the <unk> to the big part of us .
by police officer is today <unk> not just a task of the authorities , not just a task of firemen , or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , red cross et <unk> , but as communication in the catastrophe and <unk> a catastrophe about us all up .
and <unk> has been .
there 's about twitter , via facebook , a lot of the aid has gone , if you also partially of you 'll get overwhelmed was , because suddenly <unk> of people have any <unk> build stuff , and did n't work anymore where the <unk> are .
this brings out there 's more to do well , for public communication in <unk> , but the unprecedented , solidarity with the <unk> and the <unk> has just demonstrated that the social media from a <unk> , from a communication is n't even more way to think are .

thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , as you just have heard .
and i 'm not just that process , a <unk> starting .
what it is that there i <unk> are going to this next i also give them in front .
before i do that , i have to get a few things <unk> .
this first is , , i believe that we 're really to live longer need .
that we can create stories that could live .
moreover , i believe that 's very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories , there , as of the entertainment business actually being produced .
then i believe that that the internet , the infinite sprawl , by actually just stay <unk> really properly . <unk> will .
and fourth , i 'm <unk> convinced that people have been created , to be creative .
and that they 're lucky ones , once you to be creative talent away .
ever more people are happy , the more than better off the world .
clearly make logically .
these better world is now , just a byproduct .
in primarily i am , like i said , a storyteller .

this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .
now get away from <unk> and the singing , not so much with , because in the moment , which it at midnight 's gone , something happens with her .
it 's something happens in your mind in your body , with their perception .
and she did n't really have to do .
they do n't know , there 's happening .
i 've now words for it .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see on the one <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and everything is quite a white .
i did feel that i 'm somehow dedicated <unk> .
<unk> .
and the other side , we have two people in the <unk> oz ; they do you very much color .
and it was at this spot once told that i 'd better <unk> and write , that i draw .
so , that first , <unk> now , their new perceptions see is an alien man with <unk> <unk> hair , the front of your heart , you very serious look and say , congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> about it at that she 's a very special kind of people heard .
she was as <unk> born .
players are people , the off your <unk> 've reached about their lifetime , games have .
of you who knows <unk> ?
very beautiful .
just imagine that <unk> at <unk> n't swords , if you ends meet , but <unk> from the pocket .
so a cube , <unk> , <unk> , everything .
what really important is , the players have a glimpse of their <unk> .
we do n't know , but also frustrated when we 're going to die .
i wish you have to each of a long life , but we know how did n't work .
it can make tomorrow also all have gone forever .
and therefore it 's at my players , but it .
you know where does not about how much they 've actually can play .
that means , again , every lost full minute perhaps the last one more .
a player , of his entire lifetime <unk> has , <unk> at the <unk> like a candle that <unk> will .
now you have a natural wonder if that because that is dangerous , why are playing the then that ?
the answer is clearly , this .
without play , without any players around , <unk> , all of gray and only if a player in fact , he 's actually alive .
the most violent games are born .
so .
this story of <unk> and how they 're going on the world of gamers <unk> , at her first challenges that turns out and of course , inevitably its <unk> fall , that 's the story that i tell you want .
and what they do it into a <unk> .
the first season has 12 to follow , sorry for me here is a <unk> happens , the i just too late 've seen .
so , twelve follow in the first season , with a great lengths of my five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a result , after the other , beautiful <unk> told that you know it .
that television has been practicing his <unk> anything else .
this is not new .
and if it all right , then if only ' i had done .
and also have here .
we go , but really broke off .
and so what we 're going to <unk> back .
what is the most famous set out of the movie or out of a series ?
it can only a lot , right .
thanks .
as if we practiced that would .
and that 's true of my players , which is not too .
which can be pretty awful lot more .
there are so many different games .
just think <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and forth , and continued .
and just <unk> 's also the amount of the players .
and therefore are here 's a lot of stories that everybody tells you want .
now would be the next question : who is that because it all going ?
i grab a really quite high incidence of view of me .
i 'm giving me for sufficient smart and to be creative .
but i know that 's a hundred brains will produce as only one , even if it 's mine is .
why did it directly to the idea that you the <unk> with in the creative process <unk> .
what would happen if we <unk> not just <unk> or giving the best , even <unk> ?
so if you say , we invite you know very much a , the progression of this <unk> with the thing .
just imagine , for example , in the result , three appear in a <unk> on , the they 're getting really neat thing , because he 'll take on her grandfather pear .
moreover , they 're a giant fan of <unk> .
then you can go ahead , with the modern technology is that does n't even more so hard to a <unk> do .
and they invite the <unk> up where it goes straight , and this is really cool <unk> , which really interested in the audience <unk> will .
that means that 's not anywhere among , but it goes straight line there , where it ends up .
this really nice thing is that we the web , are .
and the web , you know , really do anything .
so , every medium is kind of light sport .
this is called them as viewers , you can write to draw , spin , whatever they do you want .
and if we let 's also again this texture map .
this looks <unk> bit of <unk> net , right ?
so this <unk> , in common set up .
and i 'm really <unk> convinced that blogs that was born , just sort of stories to tell .
it 's make toast , but unfortunately , not many <unk> do n't .
so , now go grab me , but even a step further and let the audience , ourselves to the players to be .
because in a <unk> .
there you can fly against the characters from the series <unk> but also pushing people in the real environment , who are going to <unk> on your phone call them .

this wonderful nuclear power , who 's very rapidly evolve .
and the i do n't responsive to be , because i would go back 20 minutes , would need .
we managed to think back together .
everybody 's let 's composed of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> and then we have this <unk> .
with this <unk> i could before the judges on , right now , i have this quickly see : the <unk> innovation <unk> convince them .
who have to the first year award for the best <unk> been .
and i need to say that judges this tire officials from the banks , of <unk> , <unk> and forth .
so sensible voices movement , you bother my .
and when i the convince you can , here with my : that internet right to use of narrative structures to revolutionize tax , incidentally , the world better , then i think , i can actually anyone to convince them .
so .
everybody 's let 's why did that mean , because now that ?
because i 've left alone in the names all sectors , covered in progress .
we have of course , once the <unk> : who is now , i 'm running , you 're running , everybody 's time running .
of course , then that die .
in the series of becoming very much died .
everybody 's cranking out of it means : everyone needs time to die .
and then of course : everyone 's time running in terms of everyone can participate , when he does n't want .
this is me getting really important .
i get 'em from <unk> and there 's nothing worse , i think , as if it 's such a <unk> will .
i do n't know , if they 'd seen that .
if you in the theater , are and get out of an actor , so in the auditorium and all the way : oh , please do n't let me .
and this is not what it .
so it is voluntary organizations interact .
and nobody has .
he can also just a viewer to be .
the reason i german , talking about is of that all the project , the german , you 're going to be once .
this has been a few reasons .

why i can just say , the german <unk> is the third largest of the world .
the <unk> is the english , get out of spanish , and then the german .
it 's now let 's not , when we would have in any salaries niche by moving .
furthermore think i really actually really , if it also other people that goes like me that people would be grateful to be for something that 's not by any <unk> <unk> was , where the end up every <unk> and every pun <unk> 's ever been .
if that goes , just as i 'd been , is going to the result now on the first <unk> <unk> online .

why i 'd also a couple of thoughts .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also known as dependent upon <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were also , and <unk> .
and i can really just say that this completely unaware of incredibly important is , and incredibly <unk> .
but it uses , everything is nothing , if you did n't apply them .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just look at all taken from college , i would 've learned .
and it applied tumor did .
and yet , where he 's good .
i can really just say .
so , if we 're going on anybody thinks that i 'm trying to get necessarily have been part up , i had 19 degrees ' one idea <unk> character or i did this ai drawing <unk> cartoon , whatever , that 's also have already now .
you find ourselves into the internet .
on facebook .
well , like releasing the speakers about them .
yes , <unk> ' i also .
welcome to say , you can memories are wiping out ?
question , to you :
you can memories are wiping out ?
now you because at all remember , in their life that 's happened ?
they 're <unk> that ?
who has who can move even at all remind me ?
it 's go there 's hands up .
so you 're memories are wiping out ?
apparently been .
thank you .
no , just want to go for us today is n't do .
but if the talk about it is pretty quickly .
again a good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk about tonight , the i 'd chosen , because he 's two of my passions into my two of those passions into the moment , connect .
i 've got 'em all over here of closeness <unk> studied and i grab me to do with the bits and of bytes and employed , the grand challenges that big through the world around .
and <unk> certain time , i also as a coach , and adviser during the private and <unk> field , traveling .
on the one i 'm going to focus on with the computer very much more engaged , on the other , i 'm currently working in the in the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , how does that one that this the human ?
how do you because that change ?
the a discount , compared to actively .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was : when we can , when , when we can see a computer building , the works , like this human brain ?
so , and i made of on there are we have fairly close .
so i <unk> ' so two , three hundred years longer does n't really need more .
but let me tell you 've been performing , why you that 's why that maybe <unk> little kid needs .
so the analogy between the computer on the one and our brains that the other side .
if we the computer taking , then based , everything , your smartphone that she was a tablet , you <unk> and also these cameras and all those smart refrigerators -- somewhere on <unk> little chip .
he calls himself <unk> , central <unk> <unk> .
those are entirely composed of <unk> transistors .
this word has determined to anyone heard and <unk> it 's becoming so as a triangle is represented .

in your computer in our <unk> we have i got 'em extra <unk> ago for five hundred million of these little parts .
and the turn out of wild mess .

more he ca n't .
he 's actually quite <unk> .
we want to go down by contrast with our brains .
our brain has been the smallest unit of this neuron , the neuron , and we have it also grow and i <unk> , a hundred billion , a hundred billion neurons are in our gray mass up here 's inside .
this beautiful but is , and reduce our command neurons have not only three fundamental connections , but who have to <unk> per neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just because it 's beautiful , is 10 trillion .
that are 10 to fourteen zeros <unk> .
so , there , you have the complexity of the brain is to a little taller than that , we currently , when computers have .
we want to <unk> time for contrast , maybe the or another way that the , the first supercomputer that had their own power station next door to face , -- ha the <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> was the campus <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> <unk> even sometimes , but the box up here it takes about 20 watts .

if we now <unk> <unk> good part up here , <unk> <unk> good calculator with <unk> , why we 're using the then you know why that we put things ?
maybe you know some of one or another this view on the web so the human nature uses only 10 percent of his brain , buy them now this <unk> to <unk> brain to be .
and <unk> there <unk> at the commercials have a bit .
ten percent , maybe , but our brain is yes , throughout our evolution to these mass <unk> , well , that <unk> smaller , fully immersed in the center 's still our <unk> with acids , everything else has to <unk> educated .
that 's probably wo n't happen , because that wo n't use .
why it seems somewhat like that we the most of it <unk> let me ?
maybe you know , the notion of <unk> ?

and these 10 percent above , that are that 's sort , our <unk> , our <unk> mind is , <unk> running , but <unk> percent , running a giant <unk> down <unk> .

and to look <unk> on this memory , coming , maybe you know some of one or other people with <unk> memory .
people , who stopped having a lot more detail to remind ourselves as i do n't seen so you can handle in the situation <unk> , and the tell you <unk> i got 'em just said yes , but already , but , where you know that ?


where does now this ?
so why ca n't of this , why we ca n't that the conjecture that 's actually might be quite close to the <unk> bit more access on his <unk> percent <unk> it .
now we 're using the well , but why can i 'm not at the at the <unk> night , remember , all the details that ?

he has even for example , in the law enforcement work and it with a <unk> worked , who had spent playing altogether <unk> , that was n't mind , that <unk> <unk> 's brain , this is n't happen , this is gone .
wonderful things came the pretty clear .
now , i wish , but it 's why , people <unk> to do .
there 's got them in a very safe session , at this end or after this <unk> bring can , even if you ca n't seem to remind you could , i could do that the hallmark of the car recognizes that , which these people <unk> , that was not <unk> , this level and fifty 12 feet .
and it 's in fact , this is the hallmark of the perpetrators of caught .
this second what i would be good morning , , he has a lady in <unk> anyway , who has told that her mother always embarrass her to alice in wonderland read it when she was a child , four years .
sitting up their lap , her mother and her mother has been reading .
and then did he does she said , <unk> , pushing into the time ago .

and then they said he said , tell me off the <unk> .
they 've actually a specimen from alice in wonderland , they found , right on this side of text of the time , the the queen to read it .
this brain has this page as she was <unk> , as a picture .
twenty milliseconds ' she read .
so yes , we 've actually retained access point , but we seem to the ordinary lives we say <unk> kind <unk> to have to us not to <unk> .
now , storing we did n't that event at yourself , how <unk> have said , he got a a picture there 's seen , a , a a <unk> , we can store , rather to our <unk> , that , we see that , we smell , that , we hear that , we taste and that , we feel , hey , if you 're <unk> at a yellow <unk> think and how they 're right <unk> <unk> , they <unk> impression , like the taste , quite <unk> example .
and , it was now <unk> long last night , plunk yourself , but <unk> comfortable down , -- ha , <unk> bit upright and , then you must do i asked them to anticipate they are just look at your eyes .
and you remember a great experiences , positive that event in the recent past , yeah .
take this first , coming .
and , if you that i 'm doing , which you might notice that you to this memory of a visual part of it .
they get a little image , maybe even a movie ?
some that falls that you did n't on , because we that normally do , but that make the first you consciously .
and if you see that , then it be that they 're either in the movie now , from their eyes , all experience , or as you see themselves on a canvas .
this one that we call <unk> , that other <unk> .

who has , because a visual information problems , let 's hand up ?

well , put on <unk> on .
<unk> whatever it 's got a memory , if your memories <unk> , it does n't just that memory up <unk> <unk> feel compelled him , we <unk> a positive social event , and i did the one or other babies smile can see there was so yes , that was fine , there were , yes , they laugh , and already is the memory , maybe even there , actually save , we do our memories , beautiful or other feelings .
and now here 's what poses .
<unk> all available previously unseen world , yes , well , which is our brain power to the spot , no difference between what we actually reminded me it and what we have just imagine , we have <unk> .
well that you can test , if you look at home , <unk> sit and at something in the future imagine that i do n't happen is , they 're similar information to do something , if you remember things , in the past was .
and , , you know , but surely those stories , who they told in <unk> round , of time .


<unk> , when i 'm here , we came to me that my uncle is a picture is shown by his hut to of switzerland .
a very nice image , it 's also a beautiful shack .

and why we doing this because not with our own thoughts on our own external memories , hey , that bothers me the because , when i do that beautiful picture , at what i 'm going to go to think ?
they 've actually make a freedom and in your own thoughts .
<unk> you know how it just some people , who will see them the morning , if you just kind of embodied eyes have , is because matter ?
yes , i 've got 'em all bad , slept , i went on the whole <unk> through the head .
really all the night and this idea was sent me to do n't get rid of them .
i think it 's around the he planted the thought n't go out .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he wanted to take germany , came , because his mother in <unk> blanket and he did you just awful missed .
what the father has done , he has to each night with the son <unk> and said , or has asked , that was that one beautiful thing that 's happening today ?
what was that one beautiful , and tell me , and then did he would tell you leave , it <unk> let , it just tell you let me , today , great thing is .
and , within two weeks went to go on his son <unk> .
and then there was also okay , that the <unk> way is that comes into the back to visit .
and of today is the has all the youth would have done with the most of today is one of <unk> people that i know .
there are not so the memories , who have influence , how we are , but it 's our focus on , our focus on those thoughts , we use .
and how much energy we put a waste , or use .

what ham , ' if we <unk> ' yet , ah , beautiful , yes <unk> time there , <unk> , yes , that has to me <unk> ' real plummeted , man , this was it was fine , right ?
and then take this to the time with .
take this , in their <unk> and let them that <unk> .
or when someone <unk> bitter , <unk> , it <unk> raise your boss , or your wife , or her husband , <unk> , they will laugh <unk> .
so , put yourself also see this picture , put them <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let them in the background horses jump , yes , they laugh , why they will laugh ?
because they <unk> imagine , because we 're thinking funny are .
and they can be much better with the situation , you 've got to deal .
can pick up your memories so delete it ?
no , i think about our brain much greater capacity that 's all stored before you .
it 's doing , but nothing , because we can release them , how strong , we need to focus and how important to an event , a memory , a thought rate , it comes upon us down .

yes , the good afternoon .
thanks for the invitation .
if i 'm on a party ever asked people ask , i like in my spare myself , and tell that i together with friends , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , if i look shining eyes and the heads of the listener traverses the <unk> of <unk> crowds , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> come up .
if i then <unk> that 's looking at the film festival by a film festival , classical music is about , then , push your front of these <unk> crowds , images from ancient people that in now , long <unk> in <unk> spaces around and very focused on the art , listen .
frank <unk> once said , about music to talk is how about architecture to dance .
and like literally acting out that with which we do .
lest you still a little kids , what i 'll talk , i put them a short film , brought .
a film .

this brings up my view the most is the point .



and we are the glider positioned belief that 's called the crisis of the classical music is not at the content , at the music event itself , but to get your <unk> lies .
so we providing us the question , do we need a <unk> create that the music , the near , the friends and this force over again , there , the way that we have so when you 'd like .

we ask the parameter that they 're seeing the classic concert know space time , light , context in principle into question .
take this relationship between <unk> and musicians .
usually too , between the stage , and the <unk> a gap .
we 're trying to the time undoing .
you see it 's a picture of our <unk> .
the musician is sitting in the audience , drink beer , entertain the world at the breaks down with the <unk> to stand up to play a , two pieces , plunk yourself back in the audience .
so that will move during the evening , a little <unk> .

or that 's sitting in the concert .
in the classic concert , it 's so that you look at any one of comfortable , permanent chairs , like you here , sits and look forward , look , and listening .
but there 's music , there you can really do n't sit down .
and we have to leave you made , how can this practice .
if you will sit and at a <unk> piece of music <unk> can , then hear them automatically different way .

the audience could be yes <unk> .
so , sitting in the the evening everybody , because the front row .
important for us is that we 're not only just any <unk> do , but we went from the music from thinking .
that we gave us to ask those spaces and <unk> vague , but also the heads of the human needs the music that they affect others , how they affect all right ?
and that at concerts by night around <unk> o'clock high rates in <unk> , the s 's actually just by <unk> <unk> be , clubs , on <unk> , old <unk> .

and so we are totally happy that we 've been a few years , <unk> work together , who inspire us the dances , or movement to music to <unk> flourish which do n't actually become dancing and wrote down there is .
and that then <unk> for <unk> of beethoven , or for <unk> by steve get rich .
and this year we 've let us , yes , when you can be , <unk> lies .
we have the first time a concert , along with a <unk> implemented .

that was mostly also makes it works , because we have a major <unk> had to the us in this piece backed up .

that 's this film festival is something , from a community is what emerges .
we are totally happy in the closeness of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> a home and evolved to have .
the city , which is that in the same thing that we have great spaces and exciting place for concerts for figuring out , but too small , that we notice us .
if the beginning of the year in the spring , two weeks forty <unk> from across europe in the city are , then drops on just that in the city , more people with <unk> of walking , usually .
so that film festival by the volunteering that organized .
now makers , are a <unk> mix of students and students , professionals , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really totally total of mixed up .
and a <unk> a <unk> <unk> , that the <unk> or a coordination , and funding in the eye , it keeps , <unk> turned seven to 10 makers in a <unk> , the for a year long <unk> tasks are picking .
although even started volunteering , but they do you a year long after having an example , that <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> in a permanent hands are and to the film festival , organized in progress .
we do this one of leisure and live across country and distributed .
that means the most part of work , <unk> and on a <unk> .
just three times , in meetings we have about this year and distributed to an extended weekend , <unk> , they repeat the one or other problems that popped out now , and care for this is also interpersonal together , that just get hugely important is , if you something in motion , i want .
to film festival , even come up 20 to six hundred thirty thousand volunteers responders , long-distance relationships that for a few days or a few weeks of their hands to bring up to touch , where video taken up , at <unk> , at <unk> , at <unk> , at <unk> .
and needless to sort of fourteen days from the musicians would cause .
now you could have thought that would you all you for such a film festival in need .
but our <unk> go further .
we 've seen in <unk> in the city a large community around us , built , sort of us who supported by which is what we do .
that comes from the classic <unk> go , that goes , but also about very practical things such as the <unk> , there we have a baker , of us to bread <unk> or a <unk> , of us , fresh , providing excellence .
this <unk> going to <unk> in the city , about this whole year alberto giacometti made and sells .
down to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> a whole range from private space found that have their living room to provide the ground , the musicians , having collected information .
and this way , and mysteriously is this film festival , something <unk> in this city has and from the people in this city .
they identify on a very peculiar form and touch with this film festival .
since the beginning of the year we could tell you <unk> assisted by the citizens were there 's a <unk> to live in contact , the right now this entire endeavor of a sustainable and reliable <unk> out .

therefore we 're incredibly deeply happy about that across europe young musicians played music in their own hand , and home at taking the cities <unk> right .
if you 're still not really have imagined , how does it feels , classical music , like to experience , then they are just over .
but starting next year we 're back in <unk> and we 're going to look forward , if you actually , there are .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you think it may know , acquire skills .
you know that belongs to learning to or any effect of learning , but i mean , learning to be heard a lot more , which is also <unk> <unk> <unk> collecting and <unk> win .
you know how to experience once <unk> , a nice about formula for the <unk> .
what i think of art and culture 've learned , well , there can i was a lot of course to say , because now . ar <unk> <unk> i 'm in this field .
and why i was thinking that maybe it really would , this thing <unk> title is another <unk> have to give me , my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , power , but much work .
they now have laughed .
you receive more and the laughter , although the most of the whole adage that you know .
why is this ?
i think that has got to do that in the word or beautiful thing <unk> , we are actually detect .
art that we say , sometimes , that 's what .
work to say that to the galvao , that 's what .
even sometimes .
people , who tends to work , that 's what for me .
but at work , i think we tend to the <unk> and at the science tends to this rich , beyond the everyday life , where we get stuck inside and they 're going to our experience to collect , our own thoughts and development .

it starts with the <unk> , , for childhood , goes on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not all tell from my youth to worry though , then go further , that word <unk> let me afterwards , why i think this is too <unk> took them .
the interaction , for the first part of my <unk> life and finally <unk> , positive identification .
<unk> one of you will ever going to these pieces of <unk> sebastian stream that you know .
<unk> that two- and <unk> .
you learn you see in the first two , three years when you can reasonably practices , and i 've done reasonably practiced .
and so with 10 , 11 , i have the little bits and played , on piano , not far from here , at the <unk> , to home .
these pieces of life of a <unk> .
there 's a melody and performed , and the different voice <unk> , but she 's very differently .
the rhythm is one minute , but it 's <unk> .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something crucial in the art that 's really accomplish , and if it 's only two votes are , <unk> together , together to think if that the present the future , the past , sometimes is , <unk> , images , <unk> , <unk> things that <unk> are , the moment to bring together , this is doing art out .
and i 'm going to have learned , two distinct melodies , even sometimes , three , at the <unk> <unk> , the same time to play , any kind of it to hear , the way to highlight , the other not .
this was , i actually , i 've learned , the things .
another experience , i 've never forget and i was the concern had to think it 's me today , but let 's no way .
i piano <unk> , it was more people in the hall over here today , and the middle of <unk> i came out .
i had been forgotten .
i memorized it was playing .
so again by the front started and at the same spot , i knew i did n't even further .
this audience has more and sweated , almost as i , because i went into account for quiet on my place , i brought my notes , put them down and started this third time of the front .
and they believe that i like the me <unk> 've got behind .
but that was a very heavy experience .
perhaps that was also one of experiences , where i then i knew , well with the piano , although i 'll quickly as a <unk> had , i should n't make my <unk> go , because at them . we can be easier to cheat .
yes , the next this next chapter in my <unk> i 'm <unk> with the inspiration and there too , i want to tell stories .
when i 'll be <unk> was , i went to my <unk> and told him , rather , mr. <unk> , i 'd like a <unk> play .
and he said , oliver , it does n't .
there has a whole bunch of <unk> gone to have and a lot of experience with women raised all have .
now ask you have a <unk> young man , so , young , a sentence .
the i ca n't forget .
and by looking at i think of course , more practiced .
now i was the way down and to time in a <unk> .
i practiced , and i remember a situation that i would never get 've experienced .

i can now it 's not going to play , is not a piano , here , and i could it 's not anymore .
i have this orphan spends 20 , 30 times a row played , and suddenly occurred that you right .
and then i keep playing and <unk> , i was in a feeling ecstasy and played , and i know , that i suddenly on the ground <unk> and he laughed .
i was , except me .
i had nothing to finish , nothing in fact , and the music has to me to be done .
an experience where i 've learned , emotions in fact , <unk> .
and sometimes it 's also really , have to work that , in this <unk> <unk> , this condition , i call it 's time , the <unk> .
where all of myself along .
we had this situation in fact , then in the <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was walking up almost anything like by itself , when we the <unk> behold , has only half months took us , where you usually a half for would need .
now , that my experiences with the piano , with the artistic , yes , with the artistic quality work .
and i get to my student , <unk> .
i was your when musicians to arrive , but just as <unk> .

i <unk> given , and i 've got there were certainly , alongside my <unk> for the music to continue to get people can and that <unk> had .
in the choir singing , together to breathe , a <unk> singing , amazing experiences , who taught me very , very , enlighten have .

because the art and culture , making , to my <unk> to do .
so here to work for the art , but not as artists , but , otherwise would say , i 'm not saying <unk> , but rather than <unk> <unk> and keep doing things .
i was there in the theater and i 've got <unk> , there in germany , no <unk> for <unk> , just in vienna , where i did , and by looking at i 've been paying attention with this question is bothering me , you can do to art to be able to the framework for art to improve , a good case management , a good job managing to build up ?
and that was the reason that i 'll also <unk> 'm in my business lives , if you can see this <unk> , and <unk> years , i became very well , then <unk> .
but before i was another <unk> , and this phase i 'm <unk> with interactions .
<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , though sometimes in my resume , because i in <unk> was even born , always destruction , the <unk> oliver <unk> , about <unk> me , i have this kind of time <unk> .
but i 've become a <unk> root , because my maternal grandparents were also <unk> <unk> , and there , <unk> , i have the carnivale experienced .
that 's been done more thing , i enjoyed them , and suddenly i became involved in a different form of culture , a <unk> , a culture , who lived by people in this in this <unk> <unk> the <unk> .

and i started with <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , of my friend and colleague who was , there , we always for the <unk> dinner with music video , he had guitar , i piano , yet another one has a bass , performed , for example , i could then i memorized <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> done , so , but obviously the lyrics from the <unk> <unk> , months and practiced .
and this carnivale , that came really from the people out .
it was my destiny , that i would have a ninth november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> n't do that the wall fell .
i woke up the next day on , i was oral examination , oh , the wall is really like , yeah .
i am i 'll just going to be ready , on any questions for <unk> .
and down there was i <unk> for the cities in the <unk> .
and that 's where i had experienced , like the interaction as possible interactions take place between two german culture .
well , we speak the same language , the music is going to there 's also a wonderful and was wonderful , performed , but realizing that was <unk> , <unk> .
unlike the carnivale did n't it from the people could remove themselves , but it was a lot of the top , and that i as an asset <unk> , here to experience , like the german identity , let me afterwards , i 'll go back , you slowly trajectory completely broken up and the german <unk> then these two states <unk> it .
since is germany , yes <unk> .
since is also the federal much more <unk> places .
interaction , i then , but at all things you 've learned and experienced , the city of food .
we 've been <unk> that i had actually a <unk> , and ask yourself that time when i 'm here you i started , <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> for culture and spare time .
i have the more .
spare time for <unk> , you did n't write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
i was going to fix the first of the ladder to the <unk> .
so i am having leisure and not much so , certainly was this wonderful thing that i get <unk> had , but she disappeared , soon , because i then for education in charge , and make alliances -- for education do and shape could .
we have very much for the urban designer done , we have the if you just look at <unk> between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> see what we 're designing have to the <unk> to experience <unk> , where you interactions between <unk> and architecture into those can , from <unk> to <unk> at the blue are rocks .
many of interactions , we could and i could design and i 've experienced , and realized , that means if different kind of the different areas combined a target to track .
they memorize the way that i get <unk> of art , and more apparent relationship culture , who have n't mind that this to be a unifying between humans , between cultures , between the communities , more i said , the view , and i 'm but afterwards the art back .
interaction were also put between the <unk> this subject than we , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea of us , <unk> january <unk> , that <unk> could move around the <unk> europe and promote it .
but this last chapter , the the fifth one chapter one yet the headline of identification .
this word has happened over two primary meanings , one , i <unk> me with something , <unk> me so a and i can be , but when i 'm going to use , and say , i <unk> something that means , i know something .
and it 's always its <unk> .
i know anything with his <unk> , therefore i say , i <unk> you , or the or this community .
and i <unk> me with something , when i made me <unk> and say , that belongs to me , i want to identify .
and that 's a very big action .



an experience of <unk> i did not many people <unk> .
there , ham 's <unk> <unk> and food , two schools , and what , young girl from <unk> , from <unk> , and young chinese students from a <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , have a letter from humans , young men , from <unk> a play processed , the home , say goodbye , love , death , the last letter writing system .
and it 's been a special effect that young girl letters of young <unk> <unk> and young russians out letters of young men from germany to be visibly german .
and there we sat down one of these young men and seeing the piano , and playing these <unk> , the i 'm so loved .
and at oh , then they quoted him from a letter , and said , i 'm <unk> , he wrote him walk home as a young german , the he was playing , and i can never get a <unk> play , because my my two fingers are just <unk> are .
and he <unk> his finger , with a <unk> , sat down into the piano in this play on <unk> carl , and trying to the <unk> to play .
and it managed to give it 's not .
it was for me as a <unk> scene , that i look forward , jump i am , i said , we 've actually learn ?
we 've learned that in the <unk> that many people together something to move , but at all things we have learned that we sixties time <unk> in peace of living and culture that links that we do n't hear the minds go , because we have different languages to talk that we relate to identify , let us <unk> feel .
and that was for me a wonderful experience and you see it 's essentially learn not only about , something to know .
it 's essentially learn more wishes , something to experience and <unk> to win .
and if we will self-invent , and invention to happen , <unk> to talk about it happen is that we do some inspiration from art and culture of our own position to teach us , in a dialog with the artwork , if we interact and ultimately , at our own identity , kept working , putting ourselves with art and culture myself , let me , then we all have won .
and i hope that they are many <unk> and <unk> have , from which they 've gained in conclusion .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think we wait on this first picture you know .
so i have to <unk> support for my <unk> here as a few slides <unk> .
there are not a scientific slides , but it goes in my <unk> here 's why , one direction to find and me with a theme of navigating , where i think that 's the next few years to significantly to deal .

and then i did n't heard that you to talk , in english preventing the point , if somehow , but , if you look at it , then you see , they would n't understand , i english , trying to say , i do n't know , right , just as i say to innovate and so i have to talk , but the german , left .
how we 're going to die .
i got them there first of <unk> tell you .
<unk> was a patient in the hospital , i 'm on the <unk> <unk> , and i had fallen off .
she was about <unk> years old and has always liked to may , dance , because they do this also on her husband is reminded of the first man of the war in favor , was then .
and so she is a year in the first of may be to dance ; i went and as long to dance and probably even then a <unk> <unk> too much to finish , and then is fallen , and i did , here to the right , you see this , that 's leg gets broken , the <unk> .
a few years previously she has been through fallen , and had to the same way , with equal of occasion , been through this left leg gets broken .
and i was also been there as a physician and i 've experienced , as you for weeks the intensive lay them being with the antibiotics that was treated , which has been re-inhabited as is , and i 've got the discussion <unk> , as i was , is because that sense ?
it does n't make sense , and to a kind of old people like this intense , to use to bring it ?
so <unk> , to <unk> , the intensive for weeks , this is a people whatsoever <unk> ?
and she 's take a fixed with plans .
five years later i 'll get to the clinic , i see the name <unk> , and the way , i 'm looking good to remember , because he just so rare is , well , for long time , and has to double dance in the may , again , that other leg gets broken .
it turns out the question , <unk> i 'm sitting in fact , when i think about how a person for you decide which rumor , that he does in advance directives write it 's also a <unk> fills you ?
and this is a little bit about this theme of the <unk> .
you see here , then the <unk> the winter afternoons , how we 're going to die .
it 's a book out of <unk> , how we 're going to a report on the <unk>
and then it was so , that globalization , very strong right now moved back and that so you 're wondering what has , how can it because they 're going to be connected to work ?
you 've got , and that you in this book now that <unk> , and just said , it 's a <unk> come down so the parts are always fit .
it 's a networking of work our successes , it will also the work even more powerful <unk> be , for example , after china , this was a big issue .


and if we do this now carry on the <unk> and medical field , then there is obviously just an evolution .
if you the tv business plan to hear , what doctors caregivers and also <unk> most <unk> , then there are the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when there has documented that , you did , so it <unk> is , so it would ever paid off , and if not going to document is , he goes , the health service and just as well , this orphan , or that medical practice price we do n't .
and this feature documentary , but the work of <unk> ever stronger <unk> and more and capture this idea that , his work in fulfilling and deployment of personal belief <unk> , the background , loads like a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a good friend of me is now after the netherlands gone , because he said this ca n't really wanted to the had a <unk> practice , has the abandoned and it 's coming from holland , went to the doctor for <unk> to be .
the <unk> 're more recent developments in most of <unk> forward and he , of martin , had just experienced that are more old people commute time between the <unk> , the hospital , and go back , because the <unk> n't know , you should , if it out of spirals on .
then come into the hospital , but you 've restored to go back in my senior citizens , or <unk> , and be there beyond weapons provided .
and this <unk> had to do something that , if it as something perfectly structured them in holland , there , then i 'd just like to be educating people have to get to this thing to promote that , from this vicious cycle of <unk> and the also <unk> <unk> of people <unk> can .
there in holland , you arrived , he did n't end notice , after he the language with much effort in the lessons learned was that there are the exact same thing , this <unk> had happened .
it will also able to die , increasingly a <unk> introduced .
it 's no longer the credibility that counts , but you put a very solid , i example , not been re-inhabited as you will , or not to the hospital , when i in <unk> am .
and then becomes this <unk> .
in the netherlands is it , the third of days , finds a conversation with the <unk> instead , and the need to get to settle , i want to the hospital or i wo n't have to the hospital , when i do something happens .
just with which i re-inhabited as in , or do n't been re-inhabited as you .
this data come up with a central and there sits down the doctor for <unk> , has always the <unk> going on and then , then the decision on this base .
if we now at <unk> <unk> , the things like in the may , dance has and also be just fallen off , and imagine ourselves , who would have some of design directives , written , i want to do n't been re-inhabited as you will , then i would you get the second and dance in may be going to may , where they then they have fallen is , admittedly , no longer can experience .
and this raises my friend now , the time in holland , sitting , too much <unk> , how great deal with the event .

there 's certainly homes that this very good address , there are very <unk> people , who are advocating , but if i thought of the <unk> <unk> , and we have like <unk> patients in the year , so <unk> , <unk> that perhaps from <unk> to us <unk> be , i would ever , i say it certainly is hard to there <unk> and be <unk> self-worth , keep .

this is today is simply not the fact , but it takes two salaries , <unk> and <unk> and mostly it sufficient then you may not scarce .
this introduction of <unk> as a result in and growing the marketplace , the you manage to , acts themselves so , on the individuals concerned about .
and i get them , you notice that maybe we can escape , what do in the past , because i thought i 'll ask for sustainable , and leaves , very simple is the situation for affected n't .
and that 's where i just that first <unk> <unk> and the article , offering me there <unk> , because i think a society that takes time , so many structures , which is legal structure , at which we all this <unk> , what happens in our society .
and in <unk> article , one , upon arrival , who would the people 's much untouchable stars .
and the second set up there is , you to protect it 's top priority worldwide <unk> .
and i think , sometimes it 's missing , is another third set in there , which every one , neither move the assignment was supposed to have to see he was going to protect and to defend themselves .
because that 's a way is to herself to be free from this case , i admit that at different way , and the supposed to me any kind <unk> and one , and then they practice , i 'm looking at least not very concerned about making one , i 've ever so i 'm going to die .
because in the past it 's like , so , even if we have this subject does n't like to ask , we 're going to point at the point .
hopefully going to postpone , or <unk> .
that 's equivalent of course , my career as well , to say that i wish everyone , and there 's my point that is also worried , but eventually gets you look at the subject to ask you have , and if it 's when you may be far is , or `` well , if you <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is , it can already late in life to be late in life going to say i think about this question now let 's think .
if you do about it , what makes my point out , will you put points go where in the last <unk> , we are because essentially the five major things that my life has been ?
there 's now a book , pretty <unk> <unk> is .
there are the self-esteem of course , there are then the friends who i use to me repeat , and exchange can , who know me and the me through that live or accompany , there are the <unk> .

and there are there 's how many individual factors of course , that there <unk> , i take the 'm not all around .
but if you look at these three dots have to look , who has already have a whole bunch of tasks , how you in life there might <unk> have to the past its own going to protect .
and then come up and yet another factor in addition to be a level of dictatorship of <unk> to experience i did this of times as a text , or more than they serve as being taken .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior , there <unk> , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
our brains would only can get ourselves to come out .
so it 's not the question , we 're going to get them for me to do , who is going to me because time to deliver , to care , or looking for me to use it , who goes up to me ?

you go and then he says , how we 're going , this is the inside these <unk> , the us from outside <unk> was , it 's an opportunity to say i <unk> me about my my inner power , this mechanism to escape .
because no man can do <unk> , as i do yourself because you see , and <unk> want .
and i got there 's not fit in general <unk> or not only opinion , who say , you 're going on an advance directives fill and because you have that old 're going to figure out your right , if you have been re-inhabited as you want to see if you on an icu want .
these questions that i can in the last only after a long <unk> probably <unk> edit mode .

and to make those conversations to lead , it needs to spaces , and there i think , and it 's why i 'll talk , so called , and here was preparing to those spaces like this <unk> in food that i 'm standing here , both been trying to be on a picture times <unk> , rooms , where we 're talking about those topics we need to think , where a <unk> space is , so it does n't hurt is that 's also may not to our theory is , but that just a conversation that there is happening .
lest we , if we 're old are , certainly be able to ask , oh , a dance in the may , despite my career may very high ages , that would we 'll do .
i thank you very much for your attention .
beautiful good evening .
i pull two things with .
if you the first part to flat , is , you should be a little bit <unk>
it it 's quite a second .
we start with infinite amount .
this is really dumb , not can take .
what they do ?
there 's different <unk> ?
it 's infinite enough ?
yeah .
that 's not good , if you a process is , of what the lens on !
so , the fact , but i was shortly it down , for that you know it .
this is exactly what we do n't .
we employ us with just one .
and i frontier that would like a little off a finite planet .
<unk> , <unk> , we know , infinity we form of us a to know .
and it goes , for <unk> to take orders of amounts .
if we in a finite to arrive right now , and those two <unk> , of an example , chairs , the other people .
we know , suppose , already now , we can get into the box , pure , the number is small , there are three : chairs and there are three people .
we can we 're checking , whether in any amount of the same number of elements in it is
they count , how would we 're doing it ?
that means we would take some people <unk> , one , two , three , we get the three , we count the chairs , look at 3 : chairs , one , two , three , three and three c 's three , and beautifully .
that they do , yeah ?
very beautiful .
this works in a finite wonderful thing that works , too large numbers , although it has been bugging me .
but it matches .
how can be more sophisticated counting ?
how do you 'll check out there 's so many people like the chairs out there are
i realized , chairs and people committed and not something else .
<unk> let me !
that 's called the couples that !
as well , that this is clear , not now we are the ground to arrive and to understand that all right !
not that 's very nice .
so , that 's what you have advanced a <unk> and it works as well , yeah ?
and you take a , you put them on a chair , from the mouse .
this next <unk> , way , this next <unk> , everything is it served , different people get different , chairs , not a chair would have an empty and the sets are the same size , okay ?
now we 're going to infinity .
how do we have two large infinite sets with each compare that ?
we would say the one is the size or bigger or smaller than the other .
we could we 're doing it ?
we would come up to take up .
now , that 's wrong , because the point is the , if you in an infinite , long lot to count , yes , i would have just tell you do n't come to another .
<unk> , infinitely , is clear , <unk> ?
so how to go right ?
madame ?

they had this map really started writing !
they mate . ''
so , now let 's look at this time on .
estimate , throw it 's the infinite always bad , yeah ?
you know , you know , no end , yeah ?
the point is the thing , it 's very simple .
if i example , the <unk> suppose , natural numbers , <unk> , we <unk> need the zero in the first , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we had to say we 've got a copy of this <unk> and take out of the copy of the end of a lot of <unk> pay off .
left behind the right now these digits zero , two , four , six eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all the straight numbers are <unk> on the end of a long band of the natural numbers , but on a band , lack of the <unk> , in the other things are the straight and the <unk> looked , okay ?
we call the a lot g , the straight to pay , we call the other sorts n , the natural numbers .
do you know ?
is , g , more powerful , it 's bigger than through n , the same size or smaller ?
a big ?

who 's another estimate that ?
smaller ?
who says , bigger ?
ah , who has been happening really absolutely no plan , yeah ?
this know we can not be , yeah ?
you can say , i 'm not where what 's missing , bigger , it does n't , <unk> ?
okay , they say , smaller ?
would assume , not ?
this is the conventional , you with suspected of course , it 's wrong .
and now , and now let me , why the sets are alike .
how does matter ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the straight lot , we take the zero from the natural need to mate , out .
the next one of zero , plus two boys from two , after the zero from the one , and i 'll get another <unk> .
the four , the two , the six the three , the eight , the four , yeah ?
you can that even reverse , then it 's doubling , this is clear , <unk> ?
and there 's clear , through <unk> we make it that i put it always in the lecture that 's a <unk> <unk> .
and this one , there are just the straight line looked and this band is equal to be yes ?
we <unk> the natural diet on the straight , <unk> , the <unk> are out , and this band is still a long .
that there 's only in the infinite .
so when you any of explaining , we have today we learned to have the infinity learned what 's because no end , i know , just finally ?
an infinite amount of having a property that there 's in a finite to do n't and this trait it says , is absolute <unk> , a real subset of the in the same thing is .
that they make in a finite not when they are three three people are two people <unk> , which is just another one of out and previously were serving under .
yes , we 've infinity .
is n't <unk> ?
okay .
then we do n't have a second part of probability .

so here what brought .
this experiment , i 'm sure , will go at least one third know , and <unk> it does anybody with , of that looked up , yeah ?
so , we call the doors , b , c .
i 've got something hidden , i hope , it 's not ours .
and they should go undercover , guess .
where , and they do , i have something hidden , from b , b , or c ?
to guess here , our <unk> , here .
you appreciate the c .
who has another idea ?
b ?
who has another idea ?
virtuous , <unk> , b has been missing , not anywhere to hear of picking up on , <unk> ?
so is right .
it is totally matter , they have n't mean , the three of letters to fall and i search for me one .
it 's really matter , yeah ?

<unk> , there are three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i do it 's what , i 'm just a way .
well , i know of course , where it lies .
<unk> , that i did anybody here , <unk> .
so , i know , where it 's , and that you know , and appreciate that , or whatever you it 's referred to go into a second round .
so i 'm really the playbook explain what i 'm basically now just <unk> .
so it 's so , we go into a second round .
now , suppose , i <unk> me on this b , <unk> ?
so , now i have a door to show , behind the fact that it 's and the do n't have said .
because , if they 're going to b to say , and i say , and so i know , it does n't protected from b .
then there would say , i 'm not a second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , of luck .
but i 've got yes , this is <unk> , the second round off .


they must now at a stick , then i do it 's compelling b on .
i 'm doing now this on , they want to have .
or they say , i 'm doing , c , on .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with this knowledge likely to become ?
phew , very beautiful , b is on , now i know , it 's behind , c .
or , but , thank god , b is open in charge is , i 've done a stick , it does .
it would you 're saying , it 's <unk> , we have to <unk> , way we have only two doors , now it 's no matter , to shift or to stay .
what they do ?
it is n't matter .
<unk> .
why it 's no matter ?
very beautiful .
why it 's why is it <unk> ?
yes , right , that 's wrong .
this seems right now , as if we it yesterday <unk> indeed , <unk> ?
, they are , <unk> , are a new no fun .
so , so look at the thing is quite <unk> , yeah .
understand that all between , i do n't know , six and i may not their sixties , otherwise you may i 'll have not join , <unk> ?

behind this door , because it 's a third .
and it 's always the only a third person behind a door .
they 're able to guess what they want , they have to two thirds of them in the dirt .
that means you could be on two doors to guess what do n't that you 'll walk <unk> do , you can check on two dozen a seat , then we are well , <unk> , if you the zero tax <unk> , that there 's been happening all in real life .
but here we 've just a door .
so , let 's got to two-thirds of it 's no , you know .
so strongly that two-thirds here , but it can see it just behind a door , within a man .
behind the scaling it 's not !
so , then is likely ?

so , is far more likely ?
it 's better to stay , or to go ?
now it 's easy , yeah ?
yes , needless driving !
so , that was now not difficult , <unk> ?
ha !
what we see ?
they have luck .
why ?
easy , two thirds are not a hundred percent : the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope , it was for everyone out .
thank you .
mr. <unk> that they feel like jamie oliver <unk> , of this is just by bad food and bad food and overweight people have reported that , this depressed , yes , completely .
but i <unk> 'em my best thing that later everything away is , these insights .
i come on its way of <unk> farm and i did until i was 12 signature was n't be mcdonald 's .

, yeah .
thank you , for inviting us today .
i 'm here of close up .
and i do n't know , mr. <unk> , particularly looked down to me to ask whether i 'm at ted curator at sea join you want , and over a particular topic i want to talk .
i 'd <unk> <unk> : this theme of trust .
yeah , motivation is not bad and i <unk> me the woman <unk> at that has said , maybe the power of or another , afterwards , however many sports .
if only i also full credit to have .
so tonight about the rain , jogging , to go right now <unk> a tall , but i 've got this morning in the fact , a train , because i in three weeks at <unk> june a <unk> , of <unk> after the oslo to drive it wants to <unk> bicycle tube -- that are <unk> miles .
educational me how this morning when rains this training do n't <unk> .
so if you get a ride want to <unk> to go tomorrow , early go in <unk> , i <unk> ' they take a very much a .
i did degrees said , which i <unk> ' <unk> about this theme of trust .
and i was watching it started extra credit , with the subject <unk> .
do n't worry , this beautiful , little bit <unk> , the blind faith is coming up afterwards <unk> .
i did before me a second thoughts about it made , when i <unk> 'm about how to describe me most is where i <unk> ?
so , i come from <unk> village with six houses , many <unk> , some <unk> and at my parents lying on farm there 's apple apples , <unk> and <unk> -- and what makes you go from <unk> : `` beer .
trust , at sport , obviously not in <unk> but told me : <unk> and beer .
why i 'm doing ' i the story , where i even exists ?
for me is one of very important stories that i really right from the country , the village get 'em , and there was raised 'm with two big brothers , with the oldest one brother , the <unk> is .
and the second half brother , the same way we blind is like me .
it means , of seeing a bright and dark , the way , like me just too hard , where <unk> window in space , whether it 's light at is , or out .
what today , very convenient is , for <unk> .
the , or we were able to see if you before us anything is .

the brought the old men <unk> .

and what for me , but increasingly being critical time ago , is naturally into the fact , how it 's written you trust and receive the area of this great confidence that <unk> that we all need to <unk> as something <unk> situation , 'that 's my time .
and who was for my parents definitely do is how many of them , in front of my brother and i did n't even blind people knew .
we were the first , who gets relatively sudden in their lives <unk> are .
and then they had to learn from the situation , kind of what do .
and , now <unk> i , it 's a giant happiness that my parents than farmers are not the whole day long time had lived alongside us to stand and us at the hand to lead , or to say , there 's <unk> wall there <unk> you look along and get then <unk> feel , where you <unk> .
b , that would be awkward and fight -- we 've got home so <unk> .
and b , ham , our parents separated from the start making us that encouraged , which is where to go , where we also our sighted brother is .
so , at home alone <unk> , the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , it also look at risk .
there 's the blind brother me up with <unk> <unk> <unk> farm , pushed <unk> followers , pure .
the <unk> the <unk> i have to remember today .
so is that to the big brothers -- who are not just fine , for my elbow , but for the <unk> .
and our brother and and my brothers and i we ham the <unk> courtyard of arrival there 's all have done , ma , ' you could do , especially for example , bike .
and that the <unk> brother , with enthusiasm , starting with three years , and then we were obviously also -- michael and i .
and i 've got started with <unk> to drive , how they used by a little kids , today with <unk> does <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that can .
but we have that are starting with <unk> , eventually leaving .
and then is the big question : how <unk> ma out there ?
and how to receive if you that trust , one thing that trust the parents that the children also some point out by bike <unk> and <unk> and other thing that trust of us , we 're not permanently , where does that drive .
and our solution turned out that we obviously a from our parents tell us have interviews , where are the <unk> , where there 's a car , where <unk> followers , where you may also have any <unk> things , sure enough homes -- the brain makes you 're not gone over -- we knew , they are .
and we had to us in between orient to us that one hand , realizing that one hand , also hear .
and that you can go inside here 's not all of testing , because they 're going to go here , according to do is nothing more of that .
but <unk> one evening when they let 's turn off the light and taking their bedrooms , or in whose bedroom , whatever , then they orient to .
you can try to just <unk> <unk> with the tongue , so , to orient and i 'll notice that 's shown us humans as is at the bats are also -- they become a resistance to hear .
so how the bats , the way to <unk> will also you hear , now <unk> wall <unk> resistance , because of sound to do differently <unk> will .
and this is for me in trust , trust people who are not moving increasingly more importantly , and fight .

and i just to orient to describe a big trouble and when you have a lot of accidents , the one or other , there 's obviously has already .
what i guess what today , no pictures those who got 'em , that i 'm very <unk> itself is , of one of our <unk> as children .
because it to climb onto our higher building on <unk> farm .
i realized seeing here 's written by saying that confidence that grows as well , through a <unk> diversity .
and that my darlin ' i needed to literally , because i 'd grown man , of being very much more later in <unk> and the <unk> to rely on the scientific fact , that keeps bothering you got 'em , i 'm about one thing was never know , or something i think that never stumbled upon how i go back on 've experienced .
so you can handle on the that never come to be able to drastically read .
but it 's headed toward order to do that 's obviously not everyone do experimentally to experience anything .
in education is the figure of our strengths with this <unk> to point to know where i 'm pretty well , i 've got talent and where you can just make my strengths really too full <unk> ?
and our brother and just again , the did michael and i always took along the roofs of the house .
so then said , okay , we ham , here 's a <unk> .
there you go somewhere out <unk> window <unk> of <unk> example .

but rise after all : who wo n't want to bring down ?
so i do n't .
and i made of on the others , we 're going into the generation of young women , here , not .
and by so i would be put it always with .
and then it was , and the consequence out that we eventually , all three <unk> <unk> up sitting , and the dad with <unk> followers , <unk> <unk> <unk> and do n't know , he now actually tell you do .
because we rely on the subject of course , then the way , if you be scared .


he had to turn always like <unk> that it looks like to send them back , slowly <unk> has or by johannes <unk> has , of us then returned to it .
and that finding 'em , i took just great that we are opportunities that had .
but when you worry though , this is not a principal , not necessary to launch later <unk> to do .
for me were the different sports , the in my life whenever they were , all , yes , interesting .

so to <unk> good <unk> i would never be able to .
now , i had never the <unk> .
and i go to try to do n't like in <unk> .
i go to try to prefer them out in the rain .
now not going to five degrees , as in the moment .
and at <unk> rain , but nevertheless , rather than there be .
but i ' time for me like this faith in my strengths and i had discovered that i asked different sports tasted got 'em .
as the first example <unk> .
and this for me was quite beautiful , because there 's not a lot of trainer , of us in <unk> had , has said okay , we do is louder <unk> children , but they send it 's try to <unk> couple of the blind children .
actually goes well , well , because there is that puts you belong to each other end coats .
and then you notice , yes , the other people power .
and there was always kind of my big trust , of course , yeah , when i the competition does take place to let it 's hard because you can put the other perhaps , but let 's what do , i do n't <unk> ''
so there 's just a way : and this is confidence in my <unk> .
the other grab a foot in <unk> ask , i find yourself backwards , let it fall , the <unk> head to shoot and then it 's sitting behind , and the competition is over , because it 's the full score , there .
i push it 's this is n't try it .
i had it was thinking , but <unk> .
i made of on , this is now <unk> bit risky .
and for that i would have been here now have volunteers , right ?
<unk> .
crap , i <unk> ' point .
okay .
this next for me for it was as a sport , in the school to send out of <unk> and you <unk> .
my parents were home or are , to <unk> and that they have been taught me when kids .

and there was i 'll be a way in the school <unk> to do .

and finding 'em , i used -- <unk> handle today , i 'm not anymore .
i then eventually said , well , i go to address <unk> .
and got 'em , then you 'll just begun to person , again , this is the great diversity here in the sport , because <unk> takes you 've got to force , ai n't work , but coordination , and it <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- they 've probably a lot of it 's also of their work recognized ?
this is what 's also in <unk> .
you will only then quickly , and if you know that full of trust in their technology has .
if you that trust in their own power has -- so the force that , the area also then at every other conditions , as bad weather , at the new soft power of snow , at <unk> snow , the skiing and bringing can .
and if you in my case you have faith in this team has .
because when <unk> that it looks something i think of course we depend <unk> <unk> .
and me is never seen something <unk> happens like today -- i have this word for -- my <unk> -- there 's been happening just one -- has now been through my exercise .
power , but nothing , we do n't yet again .
<unk> i <unk> did you might just once .
do with one , a , one of them , afterwards , another exercise .
what i did n't always doing at the subject <unk> trust , this is the exercise that i think of the listener to do you 'll see how it 's like , if you know it looks simple <unk> to make and fifty <unk> <unk> .
so <unk> <unk> it : it has two sticks in the hand .
by ta : yeah , did i do n't reach more free one else could i mean , my darlin ' <unk> take and on the <unk> <unk> .
n't do .
so i have to me different helping .
i put my <unk> now , of years ago , i am running .
and the accounts for me with voice of the route .
so the needs to be extremely precise <unk> do .
and that 's important for trust .
the precision somewhere in the communications , in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tells me just always <unk> , if it 's <unk> goes , of tells me <unk> and <unk> on , the conventions and then : the left at 11 , then i know it 's easy to left , so the upper part of a quaint clock , with the pointer .
if he says : the left on our little sharper left , and when he says : right on top 10 .
okay , all understood what ?
then <unk> <unk> the problem because then i need again , folks , or he got ta go back to correct , then i know definitely the , now you confirm what do n't .
and for me is yes , this whole point , if the <unk> ago i am running , then i have the really completely <unk> to go for negative to say .
what 's inherently beneficial to say , he 's for me that tool that it enables me , you really , and then quickly to be and in <unk> even faster than others , the in the competition to start .
and that i can only , when i 'm going to create , with both arms to me <unk> to me <unk> , on a leg anchored to stand and i need to go to the eyes to make -- -- or she can also open fuel , puts you know anything .

well with high shoes .
yes , and this is for me that 's important point , when i 'm at the <unk> 'm just : how <unk> i did , the guy to say , i tell the guy , because i actually just as <unk> had to , i 'm able to go from earlier -- to say , hey , you got me the right <unk> do , because of when the papers , yes , ourselves .
the white and so you know what he 'd say , needs .
so i <unk> , who told him the way for communications and just open it needs .
and that 's like in every <unk> .
if my needs n't know , he can do not going to help , but there 'm just wondered , and must say , well , i practice of one of you the curve , maybe <unk> <unk> used <unk> .
or i practice of one of you how far as i 'm cycling , you 'll tell you also look like to handle on the mountain , is , because if we the <unk> <unk> , there 's thinking , you know some time : now have it goes to be .
and then again , it 's like nuts and this thing to hear it on .
and there 's practice , ' i 'll have been times the pilot , how did this by cycling program called , on <unk> <unk> front of me goes , we 've not just 20 minutes left behind us , there we may -- so we ham the recent times <unk> minutes of needed -- then we 're going to stop it again , rather <unk> .

i listen , ' <unk> -- here there 's probably the other , who <unk> <unk> driving ?
who provides more ?
so my best in any time you have ever faster , but that was in september , and now , so in april , may , i go to be said before quite so much faster , i did it as <unk> .
and at the <unk> in the right now <unk> .
and for me , it 's these exact <unk> only then you 're just make my call up to open , got 'em .
the other people would you have exactly describing , he as to see , and i 'd like the possibility that there , my risk in perfect , estimate .
and this is for me one of very important stuff , why i say , trust is more training and not this <unk> <unk> .
so stop making it as a blind , not much , frankly -- from <unk> .
because i 'd been doing this experience we had to me a <unk> right , and left or wrong <unk> had .
and then was that the competition terms of bad because it 's next to the route , three meters <unk> .
and i 'm the three feet just <unk> .
by rapidly -- again , this was -- of course <unk> accidentally .
that i know as well , because the <unk> need to know , spin , have so <unk> <unk> .
and i do it happening now permanently , that got people say , left and say , then : <unk> , that 's another thing left .
so i was then it right , unfortunately .
it makes the ground , often not much out .
but yeah , <unk> situation with pressure , that you know , probably also all of work or the university , but anyway , if you go off rapidly go forward .
let 's obviously , precision , often , yes <unk> <unk> hard challenge .
but for me , it means <unk> trust and just above that i the risks that charges must .
and there i must be honest , say , i 'm being someone , the n't see , relative size of the advantage , because i <unk> 'em my risks in ways .
so <unk> <unk> ' i 'm pretty much all .
the driving <unk> tree , from falling slope , down <unk> , who know , i and i <unk> ' but obviously -- and this is yes , this important -- i <unk> ' along the good news sites .
which then also be done can , if that trust the arrival there is .
and when somebody has been , the map really have a hundred percent of so <unk> , as i did you need .
and that i was mostly also the same action goals got 'em .
because this is for me in the subject of trust you know that next , very important point .
you need sophisticated player and i need to really have to realize that 's because really , trust and also go ?
because the is often <unk> faster the term , the you 've used .
i trust the or the or myself .
but that 's key is yes , have to get too much depend .
that you do that you for trust a lot <unk> .
and that you know , and also -- because we do anything with <unk> <unk> <unk> needs -- we want <unk> to make a deeper look .

that we make it -- in my case for example -- from some yes , weeks , i did i 'm going on the <unk> gone .
and there <unk> ' i am : i have to me now somebody 's go on , or the i put in the case that trust you can see that just make this mountain , the top <unk> .
and how do you the then that , the bell mountain , some really up there ?
well when i 'd shifted course the giants to benefit i got 'em , some things i 'm not <unk> , if you go for example , beside me a hundred meters <unk> .
then was me that 's relatively <unk> .
ca <unk> be an advantage , which is heights , which is no problem .
and i did also keep making of heights that worked , now , regardless of the <unk> i 'm going and to look at the did i 'll teach you made <unk> <unk> or i 'm in berlin <unk> flew , there will you with <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
that 's some <unk> bit <unk> , if you 'll just standing up underneath the cars , you hear , which has n't even more difficult to see , to start know now , do it 's got sore , when i <unk> .
and things like for me , are more interesting .
when you get along the <unk> to have to just have to know , `` hey , i war on the root , i just as well , focus , <unk> and you can just fall , but also <unk> new new experience that .
and this was <unk> <unk> bit about <unk> , because at <unk> mountain <unk> it : you go every 10 hours before you go and it 's point to do n't <unk>
you go and go and it 's now , stone as to yourselves , more plants .
and you take a <unk> <unk> with , <unk> gun -- of years ago <unk> first world war while it .
so if you <unk> <unk> see which is the <unk> about the last , of the <unk> .
the only then so that the only are exciting .
we have the <unk> just out of distance ever seen or the other area .
by thermal <unk> ' i started <unk> great confidence in the <unk> -- despite his strange <unk> that he asks : i had .
because i thought i did : well , so , came out there <unk> ' i probably is speeding away , how to of this thing to the player has .
but again , it 's otherwise known <unk> , because wait to <unk> actually i 'm not really much change it .
and really exciting to be there goes , if you know anything to be hard .
so if you put in the height <unk> and the air thinner is .
or if you go along a <unk> , if you 'll <unk> little <unk> has , where it 's left , right <unk> .
then it 's particularly beautiful and if there goes that night is , and all with <unk> <unk> , which has shown us the <unk> have even sometimes said , like he started looking at the wire , so that he 'd let me in fact , in the view , a handle it .
because i 'd only without <unk> there <unk> and that was him , but sometimes to be risky .
trust , we are created that just said , so you : well , i can walk through my <unk> , my friend , the process was , a hundred percent of trust , i <unk> ' she and we have that before , well <unk> .
but i practice , ' well <unk> form of security , i 'm not permanently , focus has , because : you assume , if you the bell mountain in and says <unk> stone , right , right on one , left at 11 .
there will you some point <unk> , which is all .
so for us is a faith in the case , you made , we 're looking <unk> connection , ham , we have a rope off your backpack attached that i had in the hand , and i 'm going to put behind her in which loosely <unk> rope around .
i had in the other <unk> <unk> that i also make <unk> bit of the height of stairs i realized got 'em .
and she 's then eventually , they 're stuck with the foot <unk> stone kicked ♫ it has with your <unk> <unk> stone <unk> that just have already knew , so on me <unk> and i 'm not permanently to focus had .


but that trust is also operate anywhere else there , the <unk> , like trust , just work .

at night , you can also the girls not from the back to look at .
this is somehow not the cause of nowhere .
and then did i just begun , hah . ok , yeah , in their faith in their skills is degrees , some pretty <unk> .
you 're looking at night by the darkness , about 12 p.m. , go , it will lead undercover , no light .
this is totally <unk> , if you <unk> is , the air will be thin , just really like <unk> and now , no longer <unk> once .
and then come , but some kind of the moment , where the stop have said : man , that was actually getting practical , behind you to go , because the friend of me up my arrival of all explained , we 've constantly <unk> -- like that women to be able to do .
have all the night let 's something was told , and the other the group had exactly what they did earlier -- but the recognition , <unk> to know it is now only <unk> hour , that you me then told .
or i know what 's a different now , did not the mountain , telling .
and this was to know it 's even if there , which may also just lousy about <unk> about how we may have been talking about -- there are just <unk> hour , the sun 's going on .
these same things , this is even mirrors from outside can trust , again , significantly increase and you can come to contribute to thank you like the personal medal but just been attained .
and for me is trust , especially if given and it 's especially when the perfect , if you like the personal medal and that , you really do n't want , then eventually it 's also the idea of the right there is .
this is obviously when you 're looking at sport , with the gold , that you like <unk> -- i know , actually also not why this <unk> make -- maybe , i do n't know , the value to test , or a peek , whether it 's at that lead <unk> is

if all this is real gold would , then <unk> i 'm not here , but if i took the <unk> , i made me .
or at least in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but as i said , i made of on this real , why you do this , is that you can imagine : did i actually degrees , created and how i mean , skills and forces are focused on a point .
how did i put into my skills , but obviously in the team , that we all need no matter whether in studying , in the job in which one thing , whatever .
however , if the old man , or young woman , we need to people , people who we ca n't trust .
and so if we do our goal in the head clear to see the have this and also have achieved , then that is the best of evidence that we at least in a project in our lives of trust our way .
and if you might think that they can , you can use it 's also be in other areas .
thank
a science to me that 's the title of my talks , of that 's going <unk> its beautiful maps .
what i 'm driving , is the whole <unk> <unk> , the sciences , again as something <unk> in the general population to attach .
basically , if i 'm pleased to be .
if i in a <unk> <unk> , there 's all <unk> only with the literature to scientific issue , the <unk> <unk> is .
even though every <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where the scientific issue , <unk> issues , somehow intelligible to be represented .
every station has at least one <unk> , sort of scientific issue processed to .





there , there can i found myself identifying strongly .
bang <unk> , there i can not about laughter , i understand the jokes you know , but it 's awesome .
this is extremely sad .
because , that 's like a little bit paradox of the future we 'll just going to be able to be technological <unk> and themes .
but at bay area that none for itself .
i have a couple quick examples have collected , like science , or the sciences , right now , let 's a <unk> have .
there 's just a <unk> example : to who has a tower being built , <unk> , the architect , let 's not just , we build this time somehow , so <unk> .

this was this will go through the press , there was not just a jaguar .
so sad , the heat that they <unk> that this poor <unk> , the really long time it saved up , there are the <unk> <unk> .
to ask you , an architect , has the n't actually somehow i try to be a little bit what physics , i learned , because i mean , is yes , completely remixable , that as a mirror to do is focused .
so , i 've found , completely remixable , is <unk> , somehow <unk> before christ , supposedly comes to ultraviolet a fleet <unk> it .
it 's wrong question i really , has more of the design or an architect , or where he has studied ?
now that 's a whole <unk> example .
a classic , which <unk> such a recent themes that , is also the <unk> .
<unk> , this is now have a few years ago , that 's kind in the media center .
there was the train a little freaky , because <unk> changed the plants , that was at once a danger .
the gene was <unk> with green <unk> .
genes are sort of what the outcome .
<unk> , oh , there are gene inside .
there contexts , where the market farmers are really has been : hey , i <unk> vegetables .
no idea , that 's supposed to be , yeah .
so , yes <unk> tomatoes , we can think about to debate .
but to the time i was at the lab , more active bonded and it was totally frustrated , because i 've tried to these guys genes in my bacterial <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came home , and my <unk> neighbor , `` <unk> , you ought to do n't come out , is because matter ?
i like : yeah , i 'm trying to have been three days , so little gene in my bacteria to transform and it does n't work .
this was , i 've tried to get to explain , sort of a <unk> , genetics , i thought , yes , ranging from the wonderful lady , if i think of genes , i speak to do you have them , she .
this was , i actually meant , a particular sequence that i do that these <unk> <unk> bring the molecule .
but this was , the woman i noticed that .
this woman has never told then you the <unk> it !
who knows what i do <unk> , <unk> ?
genes , is different outcome .
now that 's a good about 10 years ago , and yet i did this kind of consciousness is essential .
genes , that 's anybody what the outcome .
<unk> i 'm right does n't read .
it stands up in each gene to free and it , but really in our language to draw balanced .
<unk> gets to europe , was a headline .
<unk> different to a far from corn , of it does not genes which contains .
another written down , <unk> makes a rat , they used to die .
yes , that was also a nice about the headline .

however , whether the time or the picture , all speaking of <unk> .
fortunately it is yet <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i fear , that takes too , as long .

nevertheless , we need to our future us with these technologies to deal .
now just been <unk> , nobody had this big on the subject , but it be about things are customized and you 're elected , what the most of no real idea that .
and that 's pretty sad .
how come in fact that this information from the lab in the population ?
if we wanted to suggest that little , young motivated the scientists are sitting in his lab , has an experiment , <unk> anything , beautiful and well , and he 's operating costs to get out , man , that 's cranking out to worry about that are the public .
then you have that once at the professor go .
the head , of you decide which is cool topic , putting his name , looked as <unk> , that 's always important in the science , <unk> be .
good idea , i 'm still not doing the public , it 's a <unk> .


this will <unk> , yes , but at about who really ?
now -- those institute rarely go alone , usually have multiple <unk> such a shared a substrate , a common <unk> .
and from all these will then the <unk> , who really cool projects , will take over the <unk> at the magazines were given , at the <unk> , whether it took leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> are .
this is the way .
from the base , it will keep filtered out in ivory up until the fact , really cool experiments , then , who really <unk> projects , there were , <unk> come up .

basically just the , who take care .
in the <unk> we call this is always the <unk> of <unk> .
so the , who they belong to take care , the <unk> then we have the newspaper , yes , beautiful and good .
beautiful design magazines , reached the demographic of that are being interested , and that maybe about an idea that , where <unk> it does anyone in these articles .
who <unk> ' i mean , but really ?
the <unk> , who made it anyway , what interests .

anyway , again , our future , we will only way to master to be able to talk about us with these <unk> engage .
fracking , <unk> , renewables , <unk> , that are all of issues , the <unk> are , the gentleman <unk> but not really understand , and over the he got to vote ended .

what did n't usually happens that 's a scientist , so i have a buddy , we have been good for 20 years , he 's <unk> , it 's shown us a <unk> rule , it 's not after his career path to ask .
once he the mouth <unk> and over his career telling it , he 's us <unk> .
<unk> , that are scientists , who tell you got a kind of <unk> .
<unk> , listen to <unk> on , <unk> , <unk> is already nearly as the same level as the genes .
<unk> treated , that 's kind , oh , you do n't know , behind it 's .

where is that problem , it really <unk> and normal to talk ?
i school , so , this is my idea , these young scientist , who are not far in the hierarchy <unk> are , the a little bit more malleable for , which i 'll get it 's understandable argues powerfully .
this has for all to use , <unk> , but anyway , unsophisticated investors , who want to also know , there the <unk> happens .
eventually are that again , tax , of the outcome will be used , who have actually also the <unk> communicate .
but the these <unk> , that 's just a story .
i want you 'll also really was just train judges , sit and the supposed to your project , imagine , your project in a french judges , badass , <unk> , honestly , worse it 's not my kids .
there 's a quote , i do n't know , if this is real , of albert einstein said , if you ca n't explain that moment , you 've got it 's not really understood .
so , the scientists from the lab , and your project really to rethink , how can i really that normal is intelligible to communicate ?

<unk> are totally rogers , is everywhere , looking at university , the current day , but there <unk> i basically just the <unk> .
who drives , because for <unk> end of the city in the university at any sunday morning , puts out there a talk to <unk> <unk> down ?
that are the that it anyway , what interests .
that 's where i had my <unk> .
so , that are people , who die anyway , and take care , who go ride motorbikes and out there , one of the talks to listen .
that 's beautiful , there are going to any <unk> done , all these are satisfied , all these are happy , driving home and that it .
so the channel , i still on a second aspect to say it 's left is not to <unk> the project .
this scientist will also have trained , how are wired up his children ?
because many really <unk> have , on this is essential to reduce .
because scientists , like the research , and how to raise their world , exploring , is identical .
children are working very extreme to scientifically .
they do anything like to learn the walk .
they try out what , how this ?

children learn is extremely scientifically .
that are really <unk> , <unk> walked back <unk> , i <unk> , what happens , which of factors i change has to think it works or not .
this is normal kid !
but that we have a <unk> .
and of why i think , really can work that only , if you know the <unk> , and those scientists had permanently in the neighborhood , the environment with the kids out of kindergarten , from the primary school , there in common experiments are the children , across their <unk> , and they 're really trip to engage , because i 'm convinced i am that the children and the scientists are actually basically the same language to talk .
and then you can perhaps , maybe someday , this is my hope to tell the kids that actually , at home , and then <unk> i also a gentleman <unk> , of yourself , on top for scientific issue of interest , because the kids that tell you .

and not just <unk> i 'll walk through mr. <unk> , but the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .

a scientist has to say , i 'm not can communicate .
yes , i realized then taking calls me the next to .
but who somehow was in the institute , working <unk> is in a company , but anyway , there in the next break .
thank you .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
and fly you can not every day .
the past weeks were terrible .
this weather that has a big painted by the calculation .
i was seven , soon after eight years , i 've been asked , i be here that take a line .
i was before the ceo , 10 years at the <unk> <unk> in munich , and <unk> .
we 're there 's fairly close up in conclusion .
they had <unk> as a client .
and for me , that actually more , well that 's <unk> .
but what do this ?
<unk> , i think that 's ridiculous .
i then , but what we’ve learnt to get behind and it 's why i stand here today .
and well maybe it 's a little nuts , but it 's definitely the way up through emotionally .
it 's beautiful and always exciting and makes great fun .

i 'm the ceo in <unk> .
the company , there 's been a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm the ceo of <unk> .
this company , there 's been 20 years .
and ceo of <unk> .

who runs the zeppelin i here <unk> .
zeppelin .
this an image , that here i want to show the little spot in law that 's actually a red , a <unk> looked , or anything to do n't know , you know exactly this point is still too big .
there 's a developing world 's just <unk> <unk> .
and that are actually just now , 10 to action .
this shows you know what .
there 's about 20 thousand active global <unk> .
so this is really do n't a market .
that 's not have a niche interest .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is too : why do you do that then that the right ?
how is this really ?
<unk> in the sake and as 10 to action , there , we can do afterwards , even talk about why this is .
briefly the history .
<unk> has a of a lot of crazy <unk> <unk> of aviation . here 's formed .
very short quick .

then they were in the first world war , <unk> zeppelin was dying of the way <unk> and <unk> , have been around <unk> <unk> built for <unk> .
who 've got to london bombarded and forth , and continued .
and when we <unk> and eight curves , london got around are , and a big <unk> there a <unk> campaign to fly , were the english newspapers <unk> filled with the headline said this time they come up , but not to bombs , but in new peaceful and purpose .
so that has the story to pull <unk> .
and we had a deliberate misdirection campaign .
but <unk> , the client , not quite pleased to because it suddenly realize that 's gone , there 's left behind what apparently , which the old memory in there 'd put them .
and well , that was , and , for marketing is a little different critically .
but still has been able to a good ad campaign , except that the weather in north end up there was many years ago , a very bad and very <unk> .
and we 're not a huge buzz .
then it <unk> wars , <unk> <unk> hugo <unk> has taken .
and has a <unk> seeing that then america and delivered many times .
this has a myth <unk> , that all the german nation to sort of comes back to something felt that , which <unk> and <unk> this is controlled airship hijacked by .
there was the then in to receive résumés to <unk> .
and all the german nation 's got has <unk> , we are again , who
this is standing in all <unk> so stuck inside and that is actually makes a little bit of myth of this device .
but actually are locked up <unk> and <unk> just five , six seven <unk> n't really were built and actually just two really big , the <unk> zeppelin and the hindenburg , the passengers conveyed them .
passengers , from now , where there <unk> passengers , and <unk> were just end <unk> <unk> .
it was , but a myth .
and the <unk> then was the first time <unk> crash , there , unfortunately , yes <unk> .
besides the titanic that event that time , where a an icon , a a product <unk> is , and then also never get after the flight .
but the other machines were recruited .
and <unk> , <unk> the last thing exists <unk> destroyed .
that the materials that uses for <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> mined land .
then was a long it 's about their sixties years .
and then who had the <unk> zf <unk> and the zeppelin , who had the idea , maybe you should that back to start .
and i was recruited <unk> , because it 's technically a great product has evolved to get a minute rice , but the market .
yes , he 's really a market ?
what 's actually matter ?
so .
and talk about we now .

there are many companies that made corporation , are .
there are today <unk> employees , about 20 billion of revenue .
this is a real <unk> , high as profitable .
there 's a lot behind .
who have to me , i convinced you come to come .
the zeppelin look , is actually an entirely normal power plane as any other small plane as well , but that i 'm sorry , has <unk> a gas , the helium 's not evolve hydrogen , and <unk> also a <unk> with <unk> .
it 's like a whale , of the water on and then went to scuba diving , and there the <unk> make leadership .
the time now is n't there , that in detail to explain .
the inside see a zeppelin looks like , with a structure .
there are two types of <unk> .
there <unk> <unk> , that we are , <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
who have drawn inward no structure and who are sort of how balloons , in <unk> .
that are the most <unk> that in the world 's been built these are , there 's security forces , five hundred piece .
and it 's only today , as i said earlier , just <unk> in the sake of minus to our own sake , there are only two decades .
look like , then the production of , if an envelope raised up .
the left the structure this again .
and the shell is also <unk> .
it comes from the <unk> .
the source : the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the origins .

and it 's got <unk> be , has <unk> be and also has <unk> be , because the time has been happening to that if you 've got shot in it would or a hole that 's not continue to tear it can .
there are doing the <unk> again <unk> make and peek inside , whether it 's going on the holes are controlled .
and the end looks a flying airship on without the <unk> kind of how it 's there .
the zeppelin -- is so technically a <unk> product
and that i 'm looking down here at the numbers , very short time .

this is very little bits and very good .
this is a <unk> .
that they can see the time .
but there is another trend , of us right decision making fun and the 've got up here are mapped .
we had three years ago forty-three percent <unk> , when i started , during years ago <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> and last year <unk> percent <unk> or <unk> .
and this year in may we were doing their sixties percent .
if you the eight years mean , eight years at the zeppelin <unk> and <unk> to derive want , then you can say at least in these eight years of course , a <unk> of <unk> , also clear , these eight years has to this weather , clearly changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can go from passengers if not just mist would fly .
who want you know something else .
and the <unk> or <unk> up in fact , every year peaked in .
so a little <unk> belief that our weather is not just felt , <unk> well statistically , because we make the weather , every day , changes .
but because this is , this is now that well , has the e.u. , a program <unk> <unk> to do , 10 million dollars , and we 're an essential part of this program .
i 'm morning , just from finland .
this is controlled airship on here is equipped to is a flying to become .
<unk> called the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between the earth and <unk> feet .
the name <unk> <unk> .
and the zeppelin t , flies by italy , until it up to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
over many many hundreds <unk> measures of and analyzed of the air out of people who <unk> , how they react to look at our things that we the bottom , do .
there , i just declared , up there are we 're trying to the second airship on .
a great a great assignment .
and it 's when you can be concrete derived from the theme of weather .
that 's so very good .
and here are so , a few <unk> .
this is controlled airship on in sweden , last week or <unk> week .
and finland is the way that the weather , super , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the <unk> say that they had before .
i am i 've got there 's wonderful , beautiful and warm days actually experienced .
the killing mosquitos used then also do not bad .
we were also in africa .
and have for de <unk> as <unk> diamond researching , more i said , is volcanoes researching , the <unk> are , the <unk> are any erosion , by a million years .

there , i once asked , there we do we 're really ?
and what to support we 're really ?
the end , we were looking for two years , ready .
the <unk> was actually , not on .
the entire <unk> came back then <unk> and this project was then i finished .
and a tornado that the zeppelin was at the mast , then the time that damaged , that he also got down to remain .
well , not bad .
we had just a good health insurance , and they were actually quite happy .
this was going to fix the prototype .
and i did n't know what i do to be .
yes , we 're doing , there 's just a quick <unk> out of out of <unk> .
what we 're doing , it goes up to get , it 's about complexity , it 's about growth or the sake .
what we 're doing is the <unk> here <unk> .
we make the maintenance of course .
we have to create the zeppelin was always get .
<unk> called <unk> .
there are you 've always been a device inside , after 10 to fifteen into something that might be replaced need .
we replace it all of that <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with its customers <unk> about that we 'll talk .
we do we have the <unk> constantly doing .
we 're a general aviation <unk> operation , the of the germans <unk> and of the european governance is controlled by , however , and constantly , with <unk> how <unk> , or as an airbus .
this is also <unk> and costs money and have more and also going to get .
the question is that makes sense of things ?
you want to keep innovating from ?
you make greater <unk> ?
there <unk> , unmanned <unk> .
what makes you 're really ?
you go further into the market ?
you go further in the operation ?
and this course we have in my time , tasted sweet .


i started on the billboard charts and stood still the donation of <unk> .

and what is at all of <unk> <unk> zeppelin and the other companies that otherwise , we <unk> or <unk> i today anyway , not here and also other companies would n't there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , san francisco , with a customer .
behind you put a very <unk> <unk> .
both of projects are even know it failed .
so , <unk> .
while we have <unk> won .
that 's where i 'm not a picture lead , because we do this <unk> <unk> n't show you can .
but now in america is now the <unk> the first <unk> in the finished that .
we have three piece being sold .
with <unk> to what we like a deal with a partner , the technology , a new .
and this is a great success , but at the defeat the area .
two customers are basically <unk> been , because it was .
why it was not ?
we know it actually have .
either was the location , not the right or the passengers if we needed to go <unk> or in america who knows everybody knew you <unk> the last 30 forty years the commercials have done .
the ham , people <unk> , that of controlled airship that , have said <unk> , another , again a <unk> , the power of ads .
there anybody who did n't that , there <unk> can .
and it was actually doubling pair of hard in marketing foods that over to bring : hey guys are calling up the flies .
<unk> just pretty good .
the pilot , over the year , transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but the last year we only <unk> done because of weather .
there 's missing , then they do n't even half a million .
this is then bad .
the zeppelin flies <unk> routes here .
it 's kind of the sense of course is beautiful , when i also when ceos , then i look like the passengers <unk> and , and all laughing and we basically not advertising to do , because it 's mouth to shut off and again and we about <unk> sold <unk> have and people say that 's beautiful , and i recommend it their friends , the familiar and i do it even further , the family .
and we 're great hired to .
whereas i kept going to clean have to the mistake that you think we 're <unk> .
you could still more flights to do .
we have such a <unk> at <unk> and we were <unk> .
and that is actually not quite .
we do not advertising .
this is times a project has been , that audi sponsored arabic has .
and an audi has done here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a difficult to market .
and you have even sometimes the <unk> ask much power of ads most of my mind ?
we 've been enough ads , but the internet has much change , the <unk> about the launch a while , because the <unk> this arms control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , therefore there are today , even 10 , active <unk> in the world .
we 've been , here .
two , active , one , packed , that <unk> , three has <unk> bought , 10 percent are active .
so are then six of 10 .
this means we 're going to market in fact , if it does one is to control .
and hope to be transported back , a future can derive to do .

so <unk> is beautiful .
ad to do we find even beautiful .
but we find any customers .
<unk> to do we find great , has a technological value .
there we have any customers .
this is n't actually peaked .
it 's <unk> , goes up and down .
one such as a <unk> takes years until you to receive .
and then there is then she was no .
there 's too funny effect , the easy for and hard to control are .
definitely the is that the situation , <unk> , a point in a globalizing world , actually not a market .
anyway , is going on .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power making it .
they ask yourself , just the question : the adolescent form , we do it 's doing ?
how much money give we can to keep globalizing world ?
what do what we do for here ?
in the adolescent form is that 's powered by going ?
and i personally , they called me also asked , some personal to say , i 'm sure -- that’s my prehistory <unk> , where i <unk> <unk> wanted to look back against tremendous <unk> , also <unk> has little <unk> dead are you want to do it also here to rescue .
i was also think about greenpeace , three years <unk> , when i just like vancouver island for danger 'm and this entire <unk> jungle , i 've seen , got this <unk> , that i sit there , so you hire the time .
and then there was a <unk> about greenpeace , the money <unk> are and did n't know what they do to be and i used to effectively gone are .
there you 've got to employ to this way to <unk> .
and i have three years to for greenpeace to be governed , <unk> and now i doing this in the hope , a long the future in the zeppelin to achieve .
zero , that right ? forty seconds , i 'm still done , thanks .
<unk>
yes , thank you .

why we are today in <unk> or plenty of ?
how to <unk> ?
and especially , we do ?
what 's what is going to do ?
we start with our initial point .
the first part is a little depressing .
but it 's also the drum , the challenges to show .
a few years ago , if only seeing that even more challenging me , that we’re trying to explain .
that we have a problem have today , you know every child .
that we environmental problems have .
but it 's worth spreading to get over time to <unk> , that are the challenges that population growth for example .
all kinds <unk> 're integrating exponential increase .
if you put it to a historical , long way we see the <unk> example , then that will be a very short , episode in the story more .
now , we can have n't imagined that 's kind of different places , that <unk> just keep up .
you know the climate change , the last <unk> years .
some say , well , historically there were times <unk> , we 're going to look at the last <unk> years on .
that you can also <unk> look , <unk> ' i also , right .
you can also say , who needs because the glacier ?
you can also say that the ocean is far away .
but it will have to get a little bit closer to get busy to sort of real challenge to things that 's really need to avoid the standard , otherwise we 've just having trouble with the <unk> , the health .
<unk> 's a whole array days over 30 degrees .
and there 's serving the degrees ' in our cities like in vienna , or <unk> sort of becoming increasingly more and sort of bad .
it goes , but also about the <unk> , especially in asia .
so you think the himalayas , where the big streams <unk> and the <unk> depend upon it that there is continuously at the water from the himalayas is coming .
it goes past year after all do n't get the planet .
the planet is that <unk> , we do , there 's pretty much larger environmental crisis .
and <unk> , but it 's about us to the people , which we’re doing in a changed the ecosystem decline very uncomfortable will live .
it 's about loss to biodiversity .
the deserts , branching out .
this freshwater becoming increasingly less .
this is the aral sea , where an essential part of cotton , it comes from .
and this , where does that ?
all these terrible things , 'that 's try and i went to hang out in the one or another form with the global <unk> together .
with what we total of the earth from this , we harvest .

and we should just look , that little bit as possible that we consume that 's also the last year after much waste and the emissions to produce .

this is the challenge , not only climate , not just a c is o , two , <unk> by a car on another , but really different way of life .
different way that economies .
our technology essentially completely remixable , to change .
if we 'll just look at the hunters and <unk> , and there are still on the earth societies , which basically your life , come with a ton of resources in the year per person , and every year out .
in a <unk> it was then in the longest time of human history , three to five million tons .
now it fifteen to <unk> .
so <unk> did this <unk> .
and he 's very , unequally distributed around the earth .
it 's in north of more than would have shown us more than for the earth is unsustainable path is .
and other parts of the world , look at africa , very , very much less .

and the other parts of the world around at this , but more like .

and this is there 's there are very colorful , which means , there are many resources , there , where the <unk> the world are .

so we need to change , the ecological limits are everywhere , the <unk> is everywhere .
and that , here we 're <unk> life that is not <unk> .
this has already kind of mahatma gandhi , they were broken when he said , the world has enough for <unk> needs , not for <unk> greed .
and there are we , how we see the average life quite substantially more about it .
so .
this was the sort <unk> part .
but i always that , the needs to understand it 's worth taking too , to change .
but if i asked afterwards they would say , it 's worth taking but anyway , different way of life , which is more <unk> .
but it 's just sort of <unk> <unk> you need to make a rationale , 'that 's try and i first time .
so , is actually <unk> ?
and we have to notice that we came to reach into parts of the world who will do have reached the economically , socially its primary quality , a standard still have the average often do n't outdoor conditions .
here 's a pretty bad mood , but there are people , and you know , but certainly for people , who do not good can deal with this story .
i 've written down .
<unk> and climate have the same cause .
we work too much and to do .
this is on the one where we get yourself in the stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i work too much like .
and on the other cause we do this <unk> .
but what 's take a good life ?
to this defined ?
now here 's sort of a scientific <unk> .
this is also , i did before i 've said , and i later tell you 'll is scientific sort , grounded , but here is it 's arrival of a drum , how can i think this sort , first of defined ?
and there 's very important to understand the quality has always two aspects .
the quality that the aspect of objective conditions as it does to go , i 'm going to eat them .
i became a roof over the head ?
i became friends ?
i relationship , i can stay alive to participate ?
but just as well , how it 's the whole mean , how to go on myself to manage it ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes the perceived to quality .
and then <unk> ' i two in terms really bring , the amount of you 're important .
this one is the needs .
the needs are the whole principle and dimension of our human flourishing , our there 's there 's drum to feelings .
if we our needs to satisfy our degree , then we 're happy .
and needs , you ca n't say , desires are sustainable , or not sustainable .
the needs by definition se lead to do n't seem to <unk> .
what are the needs ?
the off various researchers have to quote , i 'm here 's only two glowing lobes .
and there you walk through the physical needs , but also need for safety , social relations .
seeking protection , for participation , after <unk> , creativity , spirituality , after the freedom .
this has a little bit about with money to do .
but a lot of my arrival of not actually , but the question is , how can i realized that my life research .
and there i am at the second important term .
the strategies .
the strategy that i 'm going to use the me , providing it stands to me that needs to fulfill .
and there 's there goes into the drum , i can do that we’re doing with a high <unk> or with a low <unk> do .
there i can not much money supply , or a little money supply .
strategies that are you personally behave like me in my needs <unk> .
this has with my values to do with the resources , with the possibilities that i .
if i little money . i 've got to push ' i feel like my needs to try to satisfy as if i speak , much money on account -- did .
it goes to begin to the <unk> , this is the roof over the mind to eat and then sort of the <unk> .
and here 's there goes drum , that can do much or a little <unk> , that can sort of sustainable , or <unk> be .
and if we all the strategies , who were going to apply to get my needs to fix , <unk> then we talk from a lifestyle .
so .
this was the sort of scientific <unk> .
and we go drum at what we can do now ?
how it 's how does it ?
and there 's just put some clues .
obviously has this sort of everyone for themselves will find .
but the clues to the individual kind of a technological way , here is , i made ' i , much more about technology has spoken word and finally worked on a political way .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what we do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides , at the beginning , we sort of the danger is that we speak to get consumption , and more resources , waste .
the last year after all the quality , again <unk> because also the effects of getting worse going to speak , and on us the last year after returning to beat you .
or , whether we make it , sort , there a different direction to go , the with less <unk> , maybe even with less mindful consumption , but with a higher quality that are connected .
there 's one of my <unk> , maybe you know him some , <unk> of <unk> of the subject <unk> , more lives with less <unk> .
there 's there 's a lot about technology like i can see every single thing that here we use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee pot that car , the traffic , how can i that produce ?
cement , i can now will produce , i can that house of wood , building , et <unk> .
order to significantly less <unk> more or the same quality to create .

where are actually the needs ?
those services , i can actually fix this ?

and that 's not with a bit less experience with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent less .
there 's many examples of this sort , i can .


this in essence of wood for carbonate .
that you , if you may be in fifty years longer need to break down , and then again in his bits and not speak , which we’re very much less resources that is consumed with everything else , along comes down a kind of in the moment with half of and that goal is with a fifth of the <unk> , over the entire lifespan the house designed with this was one-fifth the <unk> long run out .
it goes , but also a lot in our own , sort of how <unk> ' i really ?

where he shows how hard it has come after all is sort of really from the wrong about the sort of these <unk> <unk> .


most beautiful <unk> ' i the <unk> , that you know how all .
when i did n't institute , crowdfunded edition , so few years ago , we 're still a letter writing .
then who has we’re waiting to be able to the letter <unk> to write ' i ai email , it ai massive <unk> .
we do n't write ' i have hundreds of emails .
and i should be very much more .
this is productivity , this is economic growth , we come in a minute left .
but i did n't really have saved .
i for me just a failure is done .

and a low <unk> higher quality of you create .

there 's a best-selling , now it chairs that it ai average person at us in germany , in austria 's about 10,000 , things in a household , it .
you can you 've begun to count .
who two years ago , three generations of tens of things had , having employees , the personnel .
who have us who managed dissent .
we need for yourself worrying about <unk> .
and fewer people come out when you with these all options .
and we need an guides , of us helps , of giving us <unk> with those few things <unk> .
if only ' i made ' i really interesting , maybe is that this ai application of the spacecraft to go out , i made ' i , we do n't have 10,000 , things out .
this next example is use instead of foreign oil .
a real construction boom .
the star , <unk> , <unk> has to speak about twenty years ago , in in alternative , circles been designed .
in the meantime , use it more people , if you <unk> thinking .
if you <unk> thinking .
platforms , business models that easy to work , how do you the things that we have these beautiful <unk> here , the front of a few hundred years was built still are bringing purpose and more about the other leaders for centuries to use about it 's the last year after all .
this , even invested was just better to use .
this is the last year after all have a question of justice .
i showed you before and sort of how are unequally that 's take this as a picture between africa and europe and a a <unk> world .
and sort of like that all the same with these resources , along that 's only then when we could significantly less energy .

but it 's an important task of economics , the company , these products that services , really to provide the we need to us a good life to manage to significantly less resources .
one final thing that has also something with the big public policy to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> ' i found that time .
if you put some point at the projections to read , which is degrees away from the oecd , <unk> , now this <unk> every week in these projections were back down <unk> .
it 's called a crisis is standing in front of the door in my view , and also looking at what we sort of great deal with the economists 've talked and get busy writing system , here are the numbers for austria , you find this is practical applications for all countries growth go ahead and down .
and there 's no reason to cut growth to have to , as i do this out of my youth , from the <unk> years , you know .
for part has pure mathematics of reasons .

and that eight percent is that , china right now it .
who are also about there , where we might imagine fifty years were .
overall , if the pie bigger is , of course is harder now we 'll get eight percent <unk> .
this one percent is still much , lest we will be good living .
but you need to speak , looked to hire this means , not even if we are zero percent growth would have to marriage , that yes , the next year in the same amount to produce and consume and income people like in this year .
that we can be investing and then we can work .

the economy grows , but the quality of stays in in <unk> you know about on this level , we are .
and we’re doing jobs are even without growth as possible and that goes not so closely aligned along like this us out of <unk> and you all this suggests that will .

and it comes over and increasingly , that they also <unk> how popular format , or next week , i made ' i , in coming in the trend , a larger story with this subject to start , navigating it .

about it 's the last year after all and not to not primarily about the returns to create , not primarily about growth to create what for our countries have no more realistic .
for the peru , and those countries , china for india there is this ai n't very different story .
and this is going to just going to date , under <unk> , if we 're sort of ice grow and we just sort of this level , on this high level , we 're good your life and economies .
why i needed it 's also , politics .
it takes some targets .
it takes some indicators , say the economists .
it does n't just like this growth , but we should really look and measure and wondering how about that 's actually with the quality , up the amount of this ?
is the declining population ?
after that i think about our politicians to measure .
of course , high school is the <unk> ?
how does sort of them together ?
we need a basic aspect of mind is , the <unk> finally able to tax on and not the work .
ally of them , especially those entrepreneurs to , but also the <unk> , you know that very good .
what we’re going to share control <unk> , we do n't even a colleague , we spend it .
that you could be a different way .
the resources are some sort of reduces and therefore we 're among the resources <unk> and not the work .
and you have the last year after all <unk> <unk> get employment in creating , to <unk> to ensure that health , infrastructure , without growth .
it does , but there has to sort of a bit hard .
that means a conclusion , any one , at all levels are put in this direction , working really going to do we have very hard , we can be companies in the right products and services as a consumer sort of us to ask what we need are actually , how we do this is what 's sort of good for us ?
what we need , and we need it might not ?
the right , politics , choose the framework put them .
a couple of clues i 've been .
and the last year after all of course , the science <unk> percent <unk> 's still in the direction , to this growth and stimulate job ?
it , but unfortunately , nobody ever done .
if you the projections look if you the development and look at the last 20 years , it goes further down because it does n't go .
the politics are able to do n't and the <unk> wo n't grow and create , but this is the question how we go out with the world , which is so that we have a good life that ?


with heart , inducing suicidal , your hand , and the last year after all of the <unk> we 're going to do .
thank you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this city .
this town and many stories to tell .
one of it has just a few hundred years happened .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
on this creative problem-solving , we 'll , and the story about later .
they 're going to have to the fortress <unk> .
this is this ai <unk> , who here in the middle of this city that says , and lots of this city has n't mind , and <unk> .
another story before .
it was a hot <unk> to reno and , nevada .
a man will notice , like on his shoes , right that 's really <unk> .
so that to it 's warm .
he 's the europeans , he knows that are with the heat .
and he 's response was to put the shoe , which takes a knife <unk> not too long sting in , which fought off , where several holes in .
he pulls the shoe , again to put his army knives , and notice he has a new climate change in shoe .
it 's the shoe , of breathing , born .
and this number of you see here is the spot in the <unk> of these billionaires are on the mario <unk> today about .
a company is <unk> arise , with four letters .
the or another one of you know it .
he has the original idea , nike even and <unk> offered .
both have been refused .
so he says , well , <unk> , i go to my own business .
<unk> goes on the stock market .
we were dealing with today , several thousand employees in the scarce <unk> businesses in about <unk> countries around the world .
so much hold up creative problem-solving .
why not something to reinvent , not yet there is

if you <unk> n't know it stands for what is this is an opportunity ?
this question that has to me often very helpful , in a tough .

<unk> , little fuzzy memory , <unk> .
so what is this is an opportunity ?
and that comes from <unk> to <unk> .
what that might do <unk> ' i do this example here to illustrate .
and another example by the <unk> <unk> collected , which is the <unk> statements all of <unk> .
and the evidence , like creative people can be , if it to their own insurance .
i want you a few examples here show .
who are so in fact that was responding to the <unk> <unk> and who has made , as an ad .
i <unk> of on the awesome .
my son has the woman 's not <unk> .
he 's just <unk> , when it 's the wife by the <unk> <unk> .

clearly , who 's guilt is , right ?
the boonies .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> been and two times , almost died .
there can see her , but at least that half <unk> cash .
this last going on the crash was n't blame .
blame was the young woman in <unk> .
if you a man who are , is each other statement that anymore .
if you 're a woman who are , you know about it anyway , not .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish me and i dream of that we all troubles of creativity to use .
a lot of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and this must not be .
why not things just went to do differently ?
the old stuff that we do , the web 's routine and you are , the us might get bored , or <unk> , as opposite .
why the not just went to do differently , that <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there 's like <unk> company , the use this .
for example <unk> , who have yet these <unk> of their music powered man standing , these signs , or at the wall , for example , and there it is then maybe what to dig it .
well as a way , right ?
let 's the coffee pot to stay as opposed to <unk> .
or so what .
we have no <unk> , <unk> you .
it 's been happening today a regular experience , right ?
if you that phone , not just tap you can .
or eat them with me , they 're , starving , we both .
rude , but creative .
so something needed it 's .

this <unk> ' i made .

once the sport , once the current state of the news , once upon politics .
if you 're three times on <unk> was , is you <unk> .
let 's got the main complaint about too long <unk> at dinner .
it 's a <unk> building and this restaurant , very small , had the chefs take all shook hands of fully to do .
it was too snug .
who have thought , together , what we do ?
how we 're solving this problem ?
we can not because they 're in the kitchen .
the following idea is born .
the news desk being a <unk> <unk> <unk> set up getting fresh <unk> salt , pepper , and a <unk> .
so that comes to the <unk> in the <unk> on , go to eat their <unk> have ever known themselves hits you could .
and short time different .
a creative idea , and maybe even with the <unk> solved .
there 's a person who does it 's currently not particularly popular .
you this person is the leader of <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> .
and historically <unk> yes , the german trajectory .
already the second day , that takes a little red monday , four days .
a company has <unk> <unk> to close the month was elected , and she goes may already , which .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , we thank you .
the people come to us <unk> <unk> .
the buses , are packed , it 's <unk> run , people to organize themselves in the carpool , because each of course , after the other hand , because i said , from b to b to come .
but why do n't even though the basis tend to use and creatively from his disadvantage do something ?
sometimes you know , creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> might find out how to the company that they may know .
so we 've known that there are at the <unk> n't really goes well , but that they were at the <unk> also to save you need it 's something to worry .
or at <unk> in the car .
there , we know , yes , the different , <unk> , and all possible directions .
yes .
why does n't a piece bacon and put your car window , if you <unk> about ?
or at <unk> there 's also , fueled by the creative to create .
and all that has to deal with humor , with happiness , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son , in my office .
and sitting on this <unk> before me .
so , we have multiple <unk> around the <unk> .
and then turning off the left to right , it 's got joy , and i in my stinking <unk> 'that 's try to from you , listen up , well that 's not a playground out .
he got to me , at me , big eyes and yet , the playground .
and the moment <unk> ' i 'd actually has cells right , right ?
why is that 's not a playground today ?
why is that , we do , not the playground for grown-ups ?
that if only seeing it was arrested development assistance , right ?
if we are relaxed are able to talk about our talents to use to do that , we like to do .
and to excellence , soybean field , but more comfortable .
this , idiosyncratic , is that , if a particular day of the week from then actually changing what our brains .
it 's the first day in the week , and somehow it 's our focus on a different one day .
so another day , we usually prefer them .
so in towards the weekend .
this sounds you know , i 'd been in the media .
at every thursday 's called `` yes , already , only one day to the weekend .
or if then the most beautiful time of the year , announced that 's going to the vacation .
what are then the rest <unk> weeks of the year ?
it 's terrible thing ?
we all so terrifying jobs ?
a <unk> it had a time on the cover , given , the subject .
yes , on monday hundred years ' i and the rest of life , you ask ourselves .
or on <unk> , on facebook , across the social media becomes the subject , i picked up .
once <unk> i went through <unk> , one of <unk> in <unk> .
there 's how many terminal centers and i look at me the likes to .
what have the way in the <unk> , there 's just like ?
and one day , stuck , i was this business with these bring to buy .
and the first thing that sign that they 're looking at this is yes , actually quite nice .
so , of with love to do instead to work .
i <unk> that well , i 'm father of five kids , but i 'm also really doing now .
yes .

why that their attitude , who 's degree of manifest , which is increasingly , and further .
anybody got a few times as an answer on this direction , posted it 's not the red monday , there are your jobs .
and i wonder , even in fact , with the pink , glasses , this forward to come and say , start ' time <unk> .
what 's looking at my job is beautiful ?
this silly is , even if it 's the pink , glasses , is , it looks equal everything looked like before .
so something nice to talk , that is beautiful , it was clearly not .
the pink , glasses , it 's actually great example , this bike .
there 's what you a wonderful , the fly down the else in the eye ends meet them .
but to <unk> <unk> do n't .
so where this to be able to talk about this is n't change ?
actually the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside , <unk> .
it ends , maybe into a system where we like us feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this wheel , and running and running and running , and eventually it 's too fast this wheel , it hits the poor mouse and they <unk> out .
what makes the mouse , but it ?
you know , you know anything else , she goes back to put in this <unk> .
and again and again and perhaps the movie , every day <unk> that <unk> you know it may not ours . she falls into the soft .
that 's beautiful <unk> here with hay , they do you know , there 's a failure and it goes over and that 's gone .
and that , we as funny feeling probably has the mouse was once a concussion , yeah ?
or something needed it 's that <unk> <unk> .
i wish , many years ago , so when i arrive was from a seminar when home .
and at once , turned around the street under me , felt it was completely black , before my eyes and somehow got 'em , i stop at .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , there 's go ?

but like , go to the <unk> from ?
and i looked in my calendar , to bring that you 're doing , and saw , i worked on three weeks , and somehow <unk> me also the job .
after two decades into the <unk> and collaborator , the first , in the early to ask whether we 're at night was finally you can do .
i also thought , there 's actually else looking for jobs ?
and i started <unk> , again , other priorities straight to retire , to see that i time with my family <unk> ' , something good for me for yourself doing .
<unk> ' , whether it 's not ai n't other <unk> there in my job , a new spark off .
i realized , the talks at large groups , who make me really joyful .

and this was n't always like .
i myself recognizing there must be <unk> stress sick of power .
and sometimes need it 's really captures this shot at the <unk> so , <unk> of mine 's degree away from the clinic was discharged by design stores , after he 's a heart attack had been and at once he starts way down , <unk> .
sooner than i said , you want to do jogging , he has always impressed me <unk> you with your running , and .
today goes back on .
so forth , with <unk> , beautiful slow , at right <unk> , but eventually we 're going to invite you do jogging , go .
what happened ?
the bottom we all will be healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve the gigantic , is the drug market <unk> health .
<unk> minus four percent in the <unk> last 10 years <unk> almost call minus fifty percent , that 's beautiful , this becomes less .
this rise of psychiatric disorders , plus <unk> percent .
this is something where i think , you have this be ?
why is this ?
this is just in austria , like ?
no , people germany , it .
<unk> , <unk> , that all will be healthier .
this is here on the left to recognize .
the bottom , and psychiatric disorders because every three plus a hundred percent within the last 10 years , finds a a big german <unk> out .
the number of <unk> <unk> take too .
but the cost .
and it look at all sorts of official , we can do with this subject ?
you get away sometimes form of course , involuntary <unk> , for example here .
so is a well-intentioned .
and somebody has said , no alcohol , is also not a solution .
but then is the solution ?
what is then this , we have yet again , healthy people power and fulfilling and sheer energy system ?
and that got the years ago , and busy .
i thought , there 's something like <unk> , can go to do n't mean ?
i figure out of the job is not that part of us <unk> fulfilling and happy to do .
there are many other things that are important , family , health , think , and forth .
but in fact is yet , that we need to the most of our <unk> in the work to spend .
and if we do that , then why not that do that it with enjoyment which raises , and also makes other .
the <unk> <unk> ' i tell <unk> ' into the last thing to offer up to <unk> and to <unk> them .
these little <unk> , who just hopefully will be easier to notice .
<unk> stands for our talent and execution , freedom and environment .
that is , how <unk> ' i mean , talents together ?
in operating environment , start ' i found that , along with whom ?
those freedoms that did i here to do that , i do n't want ?
because it 's degree of <unk> , of us <unk> .
ever more of the more stressed .
and what i do what ?
the execution .
i would stand on these four areas .
and it can everyone for themselves will double check .
i had that i consider myself doing this introduces a few years , and i do this is constantly the time .
can i mean , talents to use it ?
in operating environment ?
and that means , sometimes i go into a coffee shop with my laptop to this seminar when necessary , or a <unk> .
the freedom .
those freedoms that can i 'd take to do that , let me that 's important .
and i am i did well ?
the execution .
this last ted u .
and then there 's about it keeps people , the me and explain why does n't go .
and why that you had a lot harder is .
then i usually just like an answer at this point .
who wants to find ways .
who do n't it 's why .

and they 're in both right to have .
what do with our talent ?
each of you 've got his great <unk> <unk> .
which is yes , too small .
that 's filled with a talent , with the gold , with everything possible , with their skills .
what do take us ?
<unk> to <unk> we ask ourselves that .
or if we in hospital , within or end of a life .
what i became obsessed with my talent done ?

so , we do with our talent , is my first question , also got myself , which every day .
<unk> ' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was yet another thing with a story .
that i wanted to tell about <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i 'm looking at the spot , nor do .
the fortress is this was the bailout , for <unk> than before <unk> five hundred years , the enemies , and lake .
and the enemies , we realized that that 's a fortress , so well , built was that you do n't take away .

i was <unk> time .

we let 's no longer exists out and pure .
let 's look like to handle on the that there , endurance .
the <unk> kept it from long until the day came , where the supplies , almost consumed by the time .
they had to just a <unk> the deck was the way to being slaughtered them to be as the <unk> at once , by bishop says the bishop give me this <unk> and give me three days .
bishop okay <unk> , you did you <unk> , i <unk> ' i will come to take the <unk> and help us .
<unk> going to the <unk> way .
at once look down the enemies , how about the wall of the fortress is a <unk> straw which led to keep going from left the right , and already in the early .
well , you think that , a <unk> , is that .
it 's <unk> .
again will a <unk> <unk> , up on the wall of the fortress , this time , he 's the end that black .
enemies , you think , oh , the has two more <unk> , it could handle on a little closer to take .
at night that same scenario we 'll make , one is he knows the <unk> , the deep end up being led to .
the end of the second day , after the six different <unk> that i get dressed up in a <unk> .
because they thought that takes us too long that we pause for themselves are n't come out .
and then went on the <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the one , the they had and the they <unk> have .
what are the <unk> <unk> arise .
i like this idea that all right there is , we need , and that we have everything .
are sometimes it <unk> resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's a little bit .
but then we can make you do something .
we have no idea of the power that we have the world every day in new to invent .
and if you believe that could now a good <unk> be then they 're right .
in the spring from the spring .
the coming .
and , that <unk> know there goes away the snow , there 's going to get warmer at catching the plants that amount of branches brown <unk> to green <unk> to be .
there are coming blooms eventually come from those blooms of the crop .
there are coming in an apple here 's a popular strategies that we then we harvest and eat .
there 's grain of this grain , can we will grind down into bread in baking .
there are there any animals that helps to eat .
there 's people , who then the products to send out later , food .
and it will automatically .
but if you think about that might think it does n't automatically join everything is then it 's a fear and so anxious .
and needless to this threat , maybe just very ambiguous and also very theoretically , but in the realm of these blooms of the connection of the flower to plant to play the bees fly a very , very much of a difference .
there 's research , the show that to <unk> percent of our food , at particular event does n't there were as if we do n't need bees had .
well this sounds you <unk> up because it as normal for us is , and we 're bees might also do not perceive .
there are now some time ago , a very interesting movie , <unk> , brought things .
and i recommend you look at it up .
now , but look forward to us on the lord <unk> of which is just with the bees , including the in his school , <unk> the importance of bees and powerful force .
that he doing this is a high school at <unk> and he will let 's a few things about his work with you .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
once a big thank you a gentleman <unk> and at this whole <unk> .
that i 'm here with my project , <unk> <unk> <unk> contribute something must do this about life of bees .
and that was still under a wing of <unk> about a little <unk> to tell that 's fun .

that i am i do n't no .

my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years of young when i 'm with an incredible wife annie perasa married , father of five kids have n't <unk> and have different <unk> and <unk> finished and working since <unk> many years of <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member in <unk> <unk> and in charity <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and work on the amount of <unk> <unk> top of <unk> with your own elders do in <unk> .
we 're working there in the garden , of agriculture and of beekeeping .
<unk> is yes , actually a play by <unk> <unk> and satisfaction from <unk> <unk> .
our personal flying classroom is a <unk> , a silence , a calm some point .
and she walks , for peace .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and not free , have the greeks , the relationship of honey , so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> known .
and a wonderful verse of homer , he describes how the <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the <unk> poet that sends her to him to inspire , that he had dense information can .
but the <unk> go to do not myself down , but they send their blue , bees and <unk> now the denser the lips like to wax master and crawling in the mouth inside , and again , in addition to him later , the words like the honey from <unk> flow .
a gorgeous image .
hopefully you get this to me tonight .
yes .
this flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of <unk> , this <unk> the arrival , my students with me up . we built it comes for 30 to <unk> days in a <unk> .
in <unk> schools of us in <unk> to secondary school or in <unk> in <unk> of <unk> or in <unk> after <unk> .
a <unk> after <unk> or in classrooms with us in <unk> .
the teacher , of this project really accompanied that goes with me to the class , and we 're looking for a <unk> place for such a <unk> .
usually arrive at the window into the children , you can see during this month .
and at all things , the bees , who then there are moving across the filled out and again <unk> can .
there will be a window of the slot , created .
so .
and then starting this whole with me on <unk> .
i guess so as a <unk> and <unk> ' right away from an existing <unk> two <unk> out and <unk> they 're here in these <unk> inside .

also important , we have here <unk> <unk> , and here , the edge of any fresh <unk> be , fresh eggs .
and then you have a <unk> , up here .
there 's the honey inside .
the need them , if we learned how bad weather is , and they 're not able to fly .
so .
look like that are then .
and then come in the <unk> here again , looked and begins immediately of transportation at the way <unk> plazas , or at the way <unk> place of schools .
and they 're pulling something wonderful .
ladies and gentlemen , these bees , there 's inside the then in the class , we 're experiencing a sudden a crisis .
you people much longer .
they are lonely .
they find your queen did n't .
and this is the most important task from <unk> , these <unk> makes that he looked <unk> that the queen , in the old people the left .
that people who do n't on both these <unk> sitting .
and they 're sad watching these bees .
they 're starting to <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , they <unk> .
you hear that .
they just sums up almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen <unk> .
and they 're pulling in a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , one night , they develop all right now the necessity , a new people to create , and this whole thing without <unk> , <unk> , without the conferences , without the discussions , without the opinions and the positions .
this is the people who agreed , and you put in the first night , here 's a <unk> .
because without the queen going to people after six weeks , no longer exist .
because <unk> live only six weeks long .
so .
and this first night and to bring them from one of <unk> a pen out an egg , and bring that these <unk> inside .
and there <unk> it do this ai at the queen going .
everybody , the rest of them <unk> in the high point , just like , how do that go ?
yes , we genetically <unk> , it 's all genetically <unk> .
this is true .
and they 're pulling something wonderful .
this egg , what you normally in the <unk> a <unk> if i would be in the <unk> a queen .

after it gets fed by a <unk> <unk> .
you know this term .
and immediate changes on this <unk> on <unk> ask the genetic code .
the <unk> going through <unk> in the <unk> <unk> changed .
that we had showed you have ever heard that , we eat that determines , from us will .
and at the queen is that really wonderful to experience .
three days , egg , five days <unk> .
and that can the students all <unk> .
you see that in class .
and then becomes this cell <unk> with a <unk> wax master and so that happens then also not because at that people the right now that democratic to <unk> or because one <unk> says , it 's supposed to be , or you republican back a task force which tells you do that now .
no , that happens <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , this is a <unk> or a <unk> decision .
and then count the students to eight days , my student knows , three plus five eight a queen 's so <unk> days that the queen <unk> .
and a day , if that then they 're going to happen to do , the teachers has <unk> in the <unk> there <unk> the <unk> at the students in the morning about five o'clock , yeah .
and he goes , the mother , tell me , is because with you go ?
yes , i need to the school .
yes , why that ?
yes , your queen <unk> .
yeah ?
and then we are the morning about six in the school .

and if you that really can experience then hear them first thing .
these the queen <unk> .
so .
a little taller .
and then the <unk> and cut across the queen going free .

that people who has now been an identity .
now we have three or five days to get the queen is fed orally .
by the <unk> front and receive your <unk> <unk> .
the back into the <unk> out , from people , from this <unk> .
and after five days , flying into the queen is unique piece from <unk> out .
others think now , yes , i have ever seen , a <unk> in <unk> .
wait , <unk> .
what different .
-- that we let me .
these the queen the flying now by ourselves without <unk> , without <unk> , from this <unk> out to two miles high .
they certainly have ever seen in your zeppelin .
in the <unk> and being there a <unk> <unk> now <unk> , of seven to 12 drones , the male terms of bees .
so around like in islam , where the man , different women have allowed this is the queen , the seven to 12 men has .
and so that happens in a wonderful way in flight .
the drone from the back <unk> that the queen , and that the queen 's cumulative now this <unk> <unk> all this , they 're the seeds need to three years to be able to lay eggs .
for the drone is it also an amazing experience .
when she 's done with the <unk> dies , you and falls out dead by the sky .
and then come in the queen going back and starts , to lay eggs .
there are always a , two students in the class , the that immediately see .
the also see immediately the queen .
yes .

and then come up one night , then before , to do <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> from outside , and the next morning <unk> ' i did <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and there , you see it 's still the queen .
yes .
the newly <unk> .
and vague , most of 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then come back , yes , these two <unk> come up here 's a <unk> .
in a full cane , a particular prey and now can bring people the big and <unk> be .
why the bees in the school ?
ladies and gentlemen , the kids who that have experienced , forgetting that never get .
yes .
there is yes , not only that in this class , then the students all the time with the bees are together , but the entire school goes well in this class , inside .


a few months ago who has in israel <unk> years old <unk> found in which the people at the bees are sticking it .
any human culture has to bees <unk> .
or vice versa , the bees were at any culture right .
in china in india to persia , egypt , in greece , in rome .
wherever they were doing it .
the human culture , ladies and gentlemen , are passed .
he can a <unk> , a <unk> hook , he can a <unk> join .
ladies and gentlemen , you know what kind of flowers , or a tree , the bees <unk> , they need ?
you coming out there are now , something out , now the summer of agriculture .
this out there , this is a green desert for our bees .
yeah ?

how long , they 're on the individuals blooms ?
and how long , they need , until they come back .
he can ai <unk> right .
how <unk> i 'm a hexagon ?
yes .
you know whether this is that in the <unk> the first move up is it ai n't flat on up is
look closely .
he can a math -- , a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can do to students at the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> discover .
and then goes to the question , how could karl from scratch <unk> the nobel prize for that it ?
because he accepted as the bees can see that in the beehive .
but , ladies and gentlemen , a hive , it 's <unk> .
there 's also sees a bee has nothing .
and just the professor <unk> , of many years in <unk> at the university students did the has <unk> <unk> that the bees fly away from a <unk> create the individual <unk> .
as a <unk> net sticking out wax into the <unk> a <unk> create , and now with <unk> hertz , their <unk> there , bid , and the bees , the <unk> , the eye contact with their legs , with their <unk> .
you see , these bees in the school to do ?
it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the kids lose their fear of the bees .
and develop an awareness for the bees .
they learn , <unk> , <unk> , the bees do .
and they get a warning at these creatures which basically just for us humans are .
the bees to create a wax n't even a kilo of 125 people in the year .
imagine <unk> years , the only way , and candles that you create .
they accumulate on the budding and outside at the trees that <unk> .
this is a <unk> , <unk> your people out .
and now ask you look at the summer , that are their sixties , as much , <unk> bees on a narrow space at <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's the infectious diseases , without end .
no , at the bees do n't .
because they brought in this <unk> natural antibiotics .
they accumulate the pollen , and you realize that they would <unk> , you 're going to <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .

obviously there 's a grid , before , and <unk> with a <unk> and forth , there 's nothing happens .
yes , and then , ladies and gentlemen , that pollinating the <unk> do that the bees course , and we have taken over a few apples , if the bees to do n't fly would or we would like the chinese have come to the <unk> <unk> and they themselves and pollinating plants .
there 's much more involved .
look at the <unk> , there is the meadow , is the kind of growing up the <unk> , where the cows graze again .
and there are flying through the bee up , puts out onto the nectar and it 's fermented -- these <unk> .

yeah ?
and then <unk> you that back and notice , ah , i <unk> <unk> , ah , i can go back <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yeah ?
and to possibly <unk> the bee followed us that <unk> , it on the out of nature , there .
the honey .
i 'd just a little bit about the point to come <unk> .
my students to look forward to each year , if you get <unk> build and then it 's partly to come together in schools .
that corresponds to do n't eat my <unk> but once i had a student , and there i said , <unk> at secondary school in <unk> and i told you , <unk> ' put you 're known themselves before .
and then he says , yes , so , i degrees ' <unk> <unk> .
i come out <unk> at <unk> and i 'm 20 years .
and i 've been five years in <unk> and since two years by thomas in <unk> .
and i <unk> ' to me that i 'm no longer with the <unk> have to learn best , with the hands can learn .
<unk> with the head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , <unk> secondary school .
and more than half the said , oh yeah , that 's what we 're also .

the field face yourself , and they get their self-confidence , my students and a feeling very proud .
how it comes to the bee network ?
the question is wrong .
you should be as it comes to <unk> the <unk> ?
and there <unk> ' i , but there 's the person , of the other people <unk> and make a new <unk> there .
and it says , to lead .
but at a poem by <unk> of <unk> .
who like the bee would be the sun across the <unk> feel the way to flower will find and never the direction , you lose the <unk> the fields in <unk> glory , as quickly he also lived he 'd seen , crying .
thank you .
hello , dear friends in a systematic edge .
welcome to talk about my project .
this project , of that person and my wife .
it 's the fight for an end of female genital mutilation .
in my eyes that 's greatest crimes of humanity because it <unk> been <unk> years .
the society against the women who still <unk> sacrifice every day .
first <unk> ' i imagined .
my name is <unk> , i come out hamburg .
there , i <unk> years of a <unk> run .
they ca n't think that got rid of you do n't <unk> it .
i felt that <unk> .

for example , this .
with a massive <unk> across the atlantic of africa , after brazil .

this was a ride , where i more <unk> was as <unk> , more <unk> as <unk> .


what was ruled from the war between eritrea , and ethiopia and we were <unk> of the killings , there .
and all the cruelty , which we were experiencing , we experienced the other side of infinite hospitality of <unk> , the us <unk> <unk> , arab hospitality .
and once it was that we invaded you were and our two <unk> that you see here , up with their bodies as living <unk> before us <unk> , and the <unk> said that are my <unk> .
if you like the killing people want to do you can tell us through shooting .
something no equivalent i started in any other cultures are found .
and then in too young already learned that islam means that can reduce the terrorism .
well , christians do is i 'm not be reduced on their terrorism .
for example , the <unk> .
the <unk> , the <unk> .
but rather on the true value is how to charity , social responsibility for the <unk> .
that are the values , for people who 's worth trying to fight .
after many years , i came again in this <unk> been , along with my wife <unk> .
and there were listening to get from this <unk> female genital mutilation .
when i 'll hear that <unk> percent of everyday victims <unk> are the rest 're christians and <unk> did i thought about how can a <unk> out of islam at the next part of terror , that <unk> in the shoes , push this ?
and the idea was the highest makers of islam to get the practice to sin to explain .
we were looking for <unk> at the germans , organizations who have n't we found .
there had to keep listening now we would be yes , completely <unk> , of islam have n't <unk> .
you 'd want the throat <unk> .
on <unk> of amnesty , and internationally , we <unk> our own organization , crowdfunded edition .
and they were of <unk> and <unk> independent .
and by now this battle has n't win to do we needed the images .
which consisted of scarcity .
and therefore we moved <unk> and i went back in this desert to do with the hidden camera , these pictures to do .
the terrible a bloody pictures that i show you know , but i 'd take this crime , drawing out .

what you how this is a slot , the size of a <unk> .
<unk> will now a <unk> .
if they typically get <unk> you two weeks .
unimaginable , destroyed its body and soul , <unk> their dignity .
this was beginning of the so-called <unk> <unk> .
in the <unk> go to go further .
the man has to them open .
he has never seen a <unk> woman has seen .
the uncle , have him , `` oh , ibrahim , it 's no problem .
you <unk> your penis , <unk> a and then <unk> you very hard , through .
and if you do it 's not doing , is not bad .
then <unk> you that knife and <unk> them .
this is <unk> <unk> .
when he dies a third of girls .

now , for shock has a girl who have english lost .
that are the <unk> , but in asia .
the most are <unk> governed .
and whenever we are muslims , i wonder why you have that 's done ?
i was the <unk> answer , that we need to do that stands in the koran .
it stands in the koran that 's quite the opposite .
each of believing <unk> times a day in prayer , how is unique <unk> , the creator , is , perfect , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe , they 're praying .
they <unk> <unk> , a <unk> to be the women 's wrong , has created and why you just as <unk> human <unk> could , on women <unk> .
but we 've had the images of the first <unk> was this <unk> .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there were hard and discussions , two days a long .
but we had the <unk> on our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and then came the great conscious decision , of practice is against all rights , against the religion , we need to him to ban them .
as recently that has the way <unk> this new <unk> signed .
and you put africa and the <unk> if you know , you know you , except that has for these people are valid .
and it was being celebrated , and these successes , we had actually , in other countries .
quick example of yet , <unk> there <unk> us the highest a spiritual , the <unk> the country on his message that it is a crime , on <unk> to write and that now in <unk> to wear .
for weeks , we were traveling , with your <unk> .
a hundred <unk> we had killed .
and where we came , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical , saints hospitality of experienced .
and when we do this country gets to leave my classmates , `` great of buddhist scholar and <unk> <unk> , you want to really all <unk> countries to happen ?
so much lifetime will <unk> you ca n't give
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> and there has been slow to deal .
and especially , he had an idea .
he said , if it will get it , the ten <unk> muslim world of a table to bring and the explain the practice to sin , then it 's a sin .
<unk> and i flew over cairo , in <unk> and a mosque , comparable to the <unk> of <unk> .
and at <unk> for <unk> right on <unk> , his <unk> professor , doctor , ali <unk> we got a <unk> .
he listened at the idea at was thrilled , especially , when we make <unk> that we finance this suppression .
and that we do you know about <unk> , the support us .
and then he said , i 'm going to the conference is not just <unk> , how we would think about them to do n't know , but i 'm going to the <unk> take .
and that he did .
over cairo <unk> eventually , <unk> our government transparent .
international <unk> to <unk> of <unk> the female body through cut .
under the <unk> the <unk> professor , doctor , ali <unk> .
and all these are they did .
a hundred <unk> , but the tallest of the world .
in the middle of <unk> of qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and the rest of europe , he 's the cause the <unk> because of cartoons .
so men who live and death can decide .
but you also the other .
the left of <unk> <unk> , right of <unk> , my <unk> .
the tallest of the world .
about giving next i <unk> me just a vacuum ago , and <unk> personally .
and then i do all of appreciating them .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at <unk> from left <unk> from egypt .
the <unk> <unk> of <unk> egypt , <unk> of my wife , mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much for the subject , of islam is not <unk> .

and then the age <unk> your film that , <unk> .
reality .
the men had wet eyes .
she pulled out back behind <unk> doors , after only two hours had decided , and a <unk> wrote , a <unk> .
the <unk> of looking at the cameras , declared , you decided that .
and the most important set to this was this .

he <unk> the <unk> .
we thought of the job is done , but the account without our <unk> .
because the shame , over the abdomen , the woman to talk , is stronger -- stayed when everybody 's mind .
why we have <unk> .
we have this we have the conference , documented in this so-called `` golden rule book .
a <unk> , for <unk> this world .
and because ali <unk> , the <unk> , it so good morning , this book , it , he 's a <unk> blessed .
it gets us from the hands of rent .
we were in many countries had put conferences , right to do is highest clergy like .

unfortunately , but have the most not the courage attached to this now have to announce that .
over the abdomen , the woman you 're not allowed in the mosque to talk .
just some have the courage upset .
they 're at least in universities are gone , on <unk> .
and sometimes we have some of bold <unk> found the fact , in the mosque , about <unk> have , like here .
and then it out about some speakers in <unk> .
and that are going into the individuals .
the will it spread .
but i am running the of time .
there are all dripping on the hot rocks , and it 's why i work in many other strategies , this topic that <unk> .
the practice <unk> .
but my <unk> that would be this .
i want to the great message of the highest clergy the world to announce the birthplace of islam , which is here on the kaaba , in mecca .
not at <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
if you four million people together , men and women <unk> islamic currents .
then <unk> ' i , to do n't know , and the <unk> king of my transparent up there is between the minarets <unk> .
and i do this already have trained them in the <unk> .
unfortunately , lacking in me , the last <unk> , that would be the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure , it <unk> he would join .
one was about these women to help .
let everyone else to the world needs to show , which the true value of islam as well , instead of yourself to demonstrate for making .
from terrorists than <unk> .
if i do n't that create , then <unk> ' i might be , in hamburg , to launching a crash .
so at least a lot <unk> in the mosque participate in a systematic edge .
and we could be transparent , there <unk> could .
and maybe <unk> i remember being able to suggest that little girl puts his daughters were n't <unk> needs .
then i did my life that 's worth it .
and i appeal to each of this idea now has seen or has to participate .
not join is a <unk> .

and now i want to finish by the first draft of my <unk> been showing .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .
and this is in all <unk> up there in arabic in the name <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that always have to anticipate .
and actually , we have it will also the german .
female genital mutilation , is to the koran , and the ethic of islam is incompatible .
she 's <unk> and one of discrimination on islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i do n't start seeing these to look at .
so we looked at the <unk> out , who as a refugee camp in germany , i got .
at <unk> pay <unk> have my mother , my brother and i first such a package <unk> .

my mom was completely terrified , because they did n't it 's why the let 's <unk> dinner gave them .
the third day , we were finally be resolved .
we stood up empty trash people , this stuff back to throw this was the one <unk> wife and <unk> that goes against <unk> out .
they tried to us to explain , hey , that you can eat .
this is not <unk> .
that tastes like even very good .
it 's the cheese .
my mother was pulled the eyebrows down and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my homeland , we have <unk> but the has not <unk> smell .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
now , for fifteen years , i came to my mother and my brother of china wakes up germany fled .
of escape <unk> ' i do you today .
but especially that 's not my wishes to the people to escape , which allows them and a success did .
but first doing math exercises , i 'll tell where i 'm sure exists .
i 'm <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> , the northwest of china 's life .
and this region by the chinese that autonomous area <unk> called .
it 's about <unk> kilometers from germany away .
in china to live in total of millions <unk> but in munich , is the biggest <unk> community outside of china .
and these <unk> life , so here because we in china under constant abuses of suffering need .
hundreds of chinese were extra seasonal basis <unk> relocated from the fact , that our own home to a minority and you are .
our own native language , <unk> turned out of education <unk> .
in schools and university will have only chinese students .
and our religion has allowed to choose not free to act .
the <unk> lose them among their culture and identity .
and when someone comes up bold speculation is , and for the rights of <unk> <unk> risk of time <unk> torture , or even after death .
this was also the reason , my parents to do you 've decided , with us kids to flee .
this was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
this picture is just ahead of escape that .
we did n't enough money , so my father had once leave me .
i <unk> ' at me , many people , the us at the run have helped .
i <unk> ' at me , many images .
i <unk> , grab me , but first to <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> , grab him , just before me , when i mean brown eyes <unk> .
he was big had this ai <unk> on , as well , and we met him up with his little <unk> on a parking lot .
the first rate has to vomit .
i know that many a negative image of <unk> have that the only do business with refugees exploit , and does n't wait for the fates to care .
but i <unk> ' `` i <unk> , grab him as <unk> call , not as <unk> .
because <unk> think that has conducted months , accompanied shops .
he stood up at the airport in <unk> on a <unk> and has to the last thing <unk> , whether we also really sure through <unk> came .
airport in <unk> we came up on and i remember , like my mother got to me saying goes straight out of the airport .
turn beside you do n't get .
until we are out .

i had as <unk> through <unk> .

silence .
and sweat .
a long lens .
we were finally <unk> .
in munich , came <unk> ' time i was a lot of the first responders , who have a very strongly supported them .
i <unk> ' at me the <unk> woman who inspire us in <unk> used it .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per <unk> ages of families .
at least forty children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
there alien faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to us a <unk> share .
there was being eaten , slept and done homework .
my guy came to do n't want to visit , because i <unk> , where we <unk> .
just my <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> knew his sobering .
they knew my story and <unk> me very , and they care to me .
for example , she brought me to <unk> <unk> what i 'm not keep doing .

i spent all my adolescence in <unk> .
this was for my mother 's not easy .
alone with us kids away from her husband and always in the uncertainty , because we had been happening just a <unk> and they could find any <unk> be .
i <unk> ' i remember that i 'm very , extremely aggressive , was to the time .
it 's me also slightly embarrassing , this now here 's all to say , but i need now just to my story to stand .
i was extremely aggressive and brought me in the school in no way to focus .
the 1980s brought us , once a catholic <unk> where we first time with a normal human children , bump up .
with a normal , my favorite exercises my kids that are not going to a <unk> housing has had to .
i <unk> ' i was also at the <unk> the me and my brother . to <unk> or <unk> sent them .
but lest we got there emerge .
i <unk> ' i was also making multiple <unk> <unk> who have done homework that , because our parents have a german people .
or who have to us actually image painted .
we have always very happy .
i remember , how we always looked at the fence line standing and waited until these people came , because , somehow pull out of strangers , people for us time , and that was that was important .
after two years , finally got my father stood up germany .
this problem , but that it 's not directly from <unk> after <unk> <unk> was because it in munich , apparently , no room , more for him , there .

i <unk> ' at me this period where i really get very , very happy i was , because after six years <unk> with , we finally in a standard apartment for them .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we had finally , with a apartment , with a machine is a bath , and one of your kitchen .
and i even had a room .
it was done very small and i did n't have desk being stuck inside , but it was fine , i could my door <unk> .
and i <unk> , grab me that i the time , yes , very well used in college , but i had yet the <unk> without a degree they leave .
i saw for me of any brand perspective .
there was a <unk> , who taught me in <unk> always been supported it and it 's still doing on the idea that i think about the second <unk> my degrees <unk> can .
first <unk> then the <unk> .
i thanks to the teacher , who really got believed , and i was really not easy to the feathers and i do it 's actually going to the middle <unk> .
after i came to <unk> .
and before going to <unk> came up after i engagement with my best friend <unk> at <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project , the organized <unk> .
but i was no good <unk> that did i have been done because we can <unk> a place , where we just go away .
we had a valve tube , what we 're <unk> <unk> could .
and the director of <unk> helped us some way that we 're continuing problems with you could and he <unk> us and i could have to all right kind <unk> .
and then i came to <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project where young people without a major in the possibility of wars , you <unk> <unk> .
this has got really quite well done , and i realized , art is something which i was also some <unk> .
by <unk> and the stick to <unk> got a filmmaker , upon us .
he made the movie <unk> about this life of my friends and me .
and of won lots of awards .
we realized that people who was our history of care .
he was a very special feeling , because we it 'll never experienced that had that people to be listened to have .
and that was such a moment , where i thought okay .
i wo n't have <unk> .
i had anything from my life make .


so i was just right .
i was playing with .
and this is , that after a performance alongside two editors , from <unk> <unk> on me <unk> .
and i had asked , i be interested would simply let 's own <unk> to do .
i said , super , <unk> .
i 'm sure to do 'official ' i do .
and i did for this <unk> <unk> , now , pulse <unk> and one of my vital contributions to a play <unk> , which i also known themselves <unk> was for the european <unk> placed .
and i would also actually won .
now , and study looking at the school for <unk> and movie munich <unk> have the third year , and i 'm <unk> of <unk> .
and this would ever , i do n't have been possible if not one or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> good at me , which is used to you .
they 've got really believed they asked me spaces were open , they asked me go forward , i showed how i my place in the society me <unk> can .
and to come ' i 'm going to them .
each of you 've got the way of people like me to help the second chance to get and their lives or its place in the society to find .

they have it 's total , determination , i did many terrible producer of hurdles that they got to leave .
and this determination and they could really big for profit for germany will be , and for each of us too .
and i could actually thousands of things tell , you can make , but there i wo n't have enough time i 've even though there it is , a minute and fifty , i put them a <unk> brought .
<unk> they 're going on your phone out when you can do n't tell you to do is no code <unk> can .
and then scan them the code , a and then they come on the side of <unk> with many suggestions , they concrete , can do .
and that would have just fine to help .

and then scan them the code it .
i <unk> handle it .
many have this phone , did not in the hand .

the next show text is also a little <unk> .
and most people understand it 's not .
i am making myself too hard .
and it comes this , i game 's try to deal with my vocabulary ; and my language .
i did have always likes to me playing .
and yes , then come to be about those things out .
it carries the title <unk> .
is a little bit strange yet <unk> .
is the chances that <unk> <unk> , that i 've written a job .

yes , we came frozen .

we <unk> .

but i can go .

i <unk> n't .
yes , i 'm going to get yourself also did n't .
no idea .
yes , yes , you clap of me out .
i tell ' time , either one or no .
this next sheet , has been doing with text to do .
it looks like a little <unk> .
i did this time for the insects and writing .
very polite .

it 's a little <unk> .
and worry about it 's cool , whenever i 'd like to put that their three to say <unk> .
my text which carries the title , all good things are really cool .


so we have <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and , scratch and then pumped all this is better and yes , that 's it .



now , that kind of power to be .
the text which carries the title <unk> and go look .
yes .
it 's fun , you .
the <unk> text is just a sentence .
i write the word such a little <unk> .
this is a <unk> sexual pun .
sexual is to <unk> s 's written .
<unk> s ?
yes , yeah .
it 's fun , you .

the is in <unk> written .
it 's a very long sentence .
i think it 's almost impossible , <unk> pure <unk> to explain this is the point .
here , even a text .
this day is a <unk> .
it 's name of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he 's already known , before going to him as such <unk> did .
he got <unk> whose quick woken up , and then i 'd made me <unk> let me .
i ca n't get back before him <unk> .
i gave the joy .
it as <unk> front of all other days <unk> and get back to sleep placed .
with a <unk> <unk> the face where else ?
and purpose , it wo n't have to honor , i <unk> .
and should i later came back to wake up to make it does n't get a crappy day and traded it .
there’s hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little kid .
what i said , and albert einstein , tracking him to be eating steak n't taste ?
i q .
so .
the letter q and sounds like the cow .
this is this funny .
yes , the next text also has this paper is memorizing the lessons .
is likely what political .
so , i write did not funny things .
i write on also partially very political things .
and it push it ' i often asked , where i <unk> ''
and there did i do this text message here 's written .
he carries the title <unk> .
my dad came from vienna , then in my mother and i saw her .
yes .
we would have this <unk> .
thanks for this sound .
yes , this is about when <unk> ' i thought i’d put some advertising to do .
i can do n't <unk> or so odd , therefore i have this is always <unk> do .
and it <unk> ' i also known themselves , events and i <unk> also ourselves a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
you do n't even be dropping .
and yes , i <unk> ' , i <unk> ' actually very <unk> .
and , yeah .
that do 'official ' i just have said .
it goes on the program .
we have to create advertising .
this is a little advertising , which i 've written a job .
feet .
rich in vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin a toe .
people have very funny .
i want to grab a joke about the <unk> your girlfriend , writing , but the punch it was just a flat .
yes , is not degrees , my <unk> .

yes .
thank you take it 's listening .
you staying great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me just start with a <unk> question is beginning .
why do you <unk> n't operate ?

the answer is clearly .
we know now that the life expectancy go at birth of just to about <unk> percent of genetically-engineered <unk> is .
that 's got any of environmental , <unk> give the impact on <unk> have .
why we know it still so little ?
why we will bombarded by <unk> messages from <unk> , who otherwise become part of each other -- disagree with ?
you had all began to fifteen years it seemed all of the guilty found .
it was fat .

what they <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves , with different <unk> in american <unk> internet has , and nothing benign , has changed that the americans every year 's thicker , has gone .
then who has said , ah , no .
but not that fat .
there are the more carbs .
what happens to <unk> like the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> and so on internet has .
so there are going to keep this ai n't new <unk> hurdle just hit the village <unk> .
where the whole <unk> ?
now the reason is , too fancy store at least , that we can <unk> <unk> approaches anecdotal isolated to scientific <unk> <unk> .




keith richards , was seven years to top placed .
then passed away from the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest standing man , the evidence shows you focus on the earth , lived up .
<unk> years old disease .

jean <unk> is actually <unk> become .
and they listened to <unk> on to smoke , you know , but with <unk> again to get locked up with <unk> <unk> the path of the virtue to follow and stop to smoke .
with <unk> is they will die .
what does that tell us ?
ca n't know , cigarettes , healthy , are .
but it tells us that causes a very complicated is , and we were a clean , statistics , we do we need to give you experimental media systems and we need to give you ask questions .

you believe strongly that ?
we know it now .
that lies at the testosterone up at <unk> so , in the male <unk> produced by .
and there <unk> quite common evidence <unk> men will be as old women .
you can now everybody for yourself think if that 's a <unk> <unk> is .
austria 's a <unk> country .
but it 's go even better than trade tips , no fear .
in general , we supposed to watch correlation with this causality , to confuse morality .
sounds complicated , but it 's a regular <unk> to illustrate .
there was visiting so someone ai <unk> grandma , and asks , they have , because so different made it will not eaten , that they 're old disease are
ah .
the grandma 's been born every decade of cigarettes .
this is probably this secret of their ages , right ?
now have the decade of cigarettes , maybe just not <unk> .
or , but they have <unk> and the grandma was going to inspect the decade of cigarettes , even older you .
however hard stats , are not always <unk> .
for instance , there ai n't very hard stats , which shows that people , the <unk> in the <unk> visit the age of being human beings , who does n't do .
<unk> .
is <unk> .
because that at the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's a reminder that people just enough money in the pocket ; they have to do to her age and the <unk> the treatments to do .
if i do a group of <unk> a <unk> to get food to give him and this group to 20 percent live longer than it ai <unk> the <unk> not what 's got , but otherwise you know exactly alike been considered when i actually probably a <unk> factor in the diet for affected .
and actually -- those trying been done .
have to tell you , the <unk> is very bitterly good , but even i work with my enemies , agree 'm is that the twin <unk> that life <unk> .
and this works for the different organisms .
for example , bacteria .
you see this ai <unk> of bacteria .
if we the <unk> , the <unk> line showing up to live in the significantly longer .
that same for <unk> , <unk> computer mice and recently was talking about two years in the u.s. shown that it even for the monkey 's true .
about it 's not going to be thin to be .
it 's too , <unk> of <unk> kitchen .
and that 's another experiment , in the united states has taken .
so what did did here ?
it ai <unk> taken and one of a kind of so-called <unk> administered to a <unk> diet , where you so many <unk> this day and night got .

now that you ai n't a parallel <unk> taken and who has the same with the same amount of <unk> fed up of that <unk> ai n't break off .
the people during this to eat certain bad for that , they went twice as much food .
and these <unk> now is <unk> and healthy and she did n't have <unk> .
despite having both of mice <unk> feed itself .
both have a very much food .
the a sick and the other healthy .
what 's really ?
it 's a process called cellular <unk> or <unk> clicked .

that makes sense .
and it 's like this .
you can see , in the cell , really resubmit yourself <unk> form , primarily to crashed , on the ages , <unk> .
the <unk> then with the stomach and the ingredients to <unk> and the cell as energy , again , available for sustainable .
are going to harm the age , accumulate in the limit given .
this certainly is that molecular <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> often tell you .
so , about it <unk> twin <unk> <unk> that life -- all sorts of organisms .
and it 's likely to assume that even during the people work .
and we learn that they 're not like in <unk> recommended , every little <unk> a day with 20 <unk> fight you should .
no .
but you to you say , if you 're hungry people , ah , maybe just getting the <unk> clicked .
welcome change your hunger , as a boyfriend .
and that to also <unk> sense .

now , he 's still hunt , zeray .
we go to regularly putting the fridge , hunting , if we 're hungry people .
and this is used against the biology .
now we know , and i think this is already in the bible , <unk> chapter <unk> verse <unk> , the mind is willing , but this meat is weak .
this paradise is seeing felt that looks different .

the three <unk> point here 's good , the food , the whole day , you can also have .
and that 's sort of the actual <unk> .

and that could for people to be interesting to their <unk> not enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it could have smoked was one of the hardest <unk> the way we preserve .

and we have a hundred , at the thousand substances scans , natural substances .
we have in the fact , a found that means <unk> .
<unk> is a solid substance , the in all those organisms that naturally sounds like the but also all of organisms learned during the <unk> less will .
in the skin is it at <unk> .
<unk> people have significantly less <unk> in the skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells , an example , then you talking about .
this is this ai <unk> cell division here .
is the <unk> , the nucleus , we give <unk> looked and we see many thousands of these little <unk> in the cell in bringing the crashed , on the ages , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells might be precisely look like .
and this works in the various different organisms .
here for example , shown on a <unk> .
so we ai substance , they found that the molecular <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
life , because the organisms do too much longer .
and the answer is again , you see this ai n't typically <unk> of a <unk> .
there are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days are the all dead , and forty days is about half the dead .
whenever we <unk> to drinking water , sharing , this very colorful ideas in the animals grow and surviving better .
we also know that human cells that we of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have in culture , about three times as long to survive when we do with <unk> shoes .
and the latest research , we put too close that self does life of all over mice down <unk> <unk> will .
and it 's not only that life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are more <unk> .
so .
now , you want course , all know where does <unk> ago ?
how of already says , it 's the sperm detected , you get a very high concentrations go ahead .
but i can do <unk> , also <unk> <unk> green pepper mushrooms , cheese , and a product of <unk> <unk> , in japan , big <unk> afforded , this is <unk> <unk> 's very much <unk> ago .
we have to then i said , if <unk> against <unk> helps , it goes into the crashed <unk> fix it 's when you may also pushing <unk> ?
they have to see , you know that the common denominator of all <unk> diseases is that during the ages , <unk> in the brain <unk> .
and we have in the did experiments that made .
they 're going to wonder , we have the on fruit flies .

they have more <unk> in the brain , if you 're going to get old .
and the molecular mechanisms that for remembrance of charge of those who are quite similar as humans .
now you ask yourself , but nevertheless , how to the devil has the fellow and the memory of flies to measure ?
this is that , we share with stefan seals of college berlin , you did .
they take a hundred flies and jam it out of a lot of which is a <unk> , the they love .
<unk> .
and let people who are in this <unk> <unk> .
then take the same fly to give them in the next chamber , and give you <unk> other <unk> , the they love , which <unk> .
we 'll leave the <unk> enjoy , while they 're using ai <unk> <unk> .
in classical <unk> .
then take the same fly to do the here in .
the driving this degree in the <unk> down , there you the .
and if you down here you arrived there are going to give them from the one <unk> and of other <unk> them .
where you go on the all go ?
yeah .
for <unk> .
except two people here .
that are the <unk> .
or , we say , they have a character .
i love my <unk> and i let 's try to me not just like this ai <unk> payoffs to corrupt .
okay .
but it 's this ai n't form of <unk> , the older , increases .
not just to fly .
and we could actually the <unk> of flying through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , i had come true .
and the <unk> , the brain came that were watching this , again , mined land .
that means <unk> does not against <unk> , but kicked <unk> diseases , potentially .
and that 's important , because we want to change the <unk> not the lifespan via se extend .
it is no point , the time of <unk> to extend .
and i want to do n't be released , without you 'll make a few practical , tips to give we 're that perhaps some younger you know .
now we 'll <unk> <unk> .
it 's not about that you lose weight , reduced , or merit .
there are actually now in austria , ai group of <unk> people , the one day you eat and one day to eat .

and the that this is very well through .
that is , it 's <unk> .
and avoid them <unk> .
it 's not about carbs , complex carbs , seem to do n't really dangerous to be .
it 's really care of candy .
you know now , that <unk> sufficient for to get diabetes to spark , even then if you <unk> are .
and you know , that sugar , that growth of tumors -- accelerate that can .

after 30 days are the all dead .
very low frozen bunch of glucose reach out .
it 's a <unk> effect to create .
there 's just an example , this works in almost all of organisms like .
food they routinely out-performing the fruit and vegetables .
and avoid them the gift of a lot <unk> or by <unk> whatsoever .
you know now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer to cause areas .
this is not certain circumstances for them vitamin d .
we 're here , perhaps some degrees ' in the winter of a <unk> , because vitamin d being driven by sunlight on the skin , educated .
some at least three times per week , ai half hour of sports , this is completely trivial .
cigarettes , despite the bet <unk> examples of cost you <unk> 10 to fifteen years lifetime .
they do , they were times the eternal <unk> occasionally the calm down .
the impact of praying , and blood pressure on the life expectancy is some .
because the monks of lives almost broke up on how women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> to live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> life and still no longer than <unk> .
just <unk> die , sooner than <unk> .
you believe strongly that ?



and what similar happen is probably in your <unk> .
<unk> pipes , <unk> , and what , going through alcohol in certain circumstances at <unk> .
so therefore , has no alcohol , especially an ai <unk> effect .
a permanent structure of partners that it ai family is , longevity is associated with .
they should n't a lot <unk> street , housing .
now think they 'll <unk> .
this has surely , <unk> nothing to do .
it 's about <unk> .
you can measure more you get somebody from a lot <unk> road does , the more <unk> has cells in the blood .

i can get good to sleep and the noise , i do you .
not true .
he 's still more <unk> in the blood and this is bad .
exposure to be <unk> be due <unk> course .
we know now , that <unk> very good metabolic effects that .
especially kids can be the <unk> lower .
and we also know that onions and <unk> mice , against the infectious to protect .
this was the way our grandmothers have the us with <unk> and forth <unk> have .
certainly not without purpose .
several long-term studies to verify that dark chocolate to have dementia <unk> affect others .

similar suspected that you of coffee , here is the <unk> but it thinner .
there are trials , the that show , there are trials , who does n't show .
what 's clear , is that coffee and safety of diabetes <unk> weird and now into their metabolic performance better .
and the coffee is actually also a good <unk> because he solves <unk> out to fit together with <unk> <unk> from paris able to show .
ai n't very nice and intricate study in the hundred thousand people in fifteen years to study were having demonstrated that people that every day , ai handful of nuts to eat their <unk> about 20 percent down .
this is a massive value for this ai <unk> study .
and this is for almonds , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not for the peanuts and the <unk> seen in fact , beans are .
the give just remember , by just nuts to call , okay ?
that are , but actually , beans .
so for the peanuts , is n't that .

and avoid them the shot by a lot of animal protein , because of meat and dairy , but only , if you 're <unk> and <unk> years old are .


in general , avoid them <unk> .

all <unk> heard in pathology labs .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> of has about , after this regime that lived and he 's <unk> years old disease .
he comes from my home <unk> from <unk> , is never get sick to become .
and it 's serving very good .

it 's about the <unk> followed that i do you today i 've said .
we should look at all the <unk> experiments , ai n't important fact , not passed .
you know that <unk> the <unk> me over a biological limits but a <unk> seems to be , and then finally , a <unk> .
you <unk> the old people less , and that could one of <unk> wrong with our culture be .
<unk> wrote the novel at the <unk> a year ago , he died .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece , in the the contemporary critic , especially the adolescents , fresh <unk> .
i thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question that i do you spot .
a question , where now , no one morning , they have people , because it 's a little bit <unk> because of you who 's kinda lonely ?
the <unk> it 's very low .
less , even when i thought .
it has probably wo reasons , why does not reported that , also people who is that they 're going to deliver <unk> would .
so many people confuse <unk> and loneliness and think that would <unk> .
now this is not at the case .
you see more loneliness is actually a phenomenon , among humans than to be alone .

you feel that you 'll be lonely , or is you very lonely ?
and you are lonely , feel , without feeling lonely place to .
and you can be lonely be without taking the moment lonely , to feel .
and loneliness that too much to shame to do .

and loneliness that leads to shame and shame , resulting in loneliness .
and loneliness takes time .
also needed to now here , nobody had reported that in the few seconds , which i tell you 've given .
and loneliness to take <unk> .
and loneliness to take the time , as to contribute at all aware of being .
and loneliness is also need training exercise to talk about being able to .

we have neither the language that we signal for ourselves to recognize when we are lonely ?
there are available , and loneliness to two <unk> , which way , i faced in .
the one part of mankind , says , is from beginning of a lonely .
of birth to death is you actually just kinda lonely .
there 's a few moments in life where you that <unk> can .
these people go then we tend to <unk> and drive down the whole day .
i did n't go , is your <unk> .
and then there are people might be less <unk> , who say everything is with everything connected .
that i think there 's not actually , so , i is just a part of the big universe .
and there 's the large sample , to the i also one of the try to try to think .
the think about today , i 'm feeling lonely and the next day , oh , it goes into all together .
if we 're more loneliness to think drops to do the first of the whole big and loneliness to put it .
the loneliness to the <unk> of loneliness to the sick on an icu .
but about this <unk> , about these large <unk> <unk> handle today , i do n't talk , but i want to talk about the little over the everyday <unk> , and loneliness to people like a theater of ideas can .
i 'm not talking about the burden , and <unk> the <unk> .
and loneliness to happen to discover , drops to do n't really profound and loneliness to us to establish <unk> already .
the photographer christine , tailors , has the break a few photos taken that i want to show you .
how easy it to do it falls back from loneliness to discover .
you know that we 're not whether these people who 's actually in this moment , lonely , have felt .
but who knows it’s not the moment on <unk> event , where you think , all chatter with each other , but you do n't know , something lost in the corner and has anybody to <unk> .
this sudden <unk> loneliness that 's safe here all .
may have some of them today , have experienced .
what you about it does it pulls that cell phone out very often , that you could be very well , and seeing is that <unk> , that <unk> on the phone has an escape , <unk> .
more visible , if you on this display , look .
what we now here 's not .
yes , and then there is the loneliness to the degrees until you sitting there of solitude and one <unk> on <unk> stage , hundreds of <unk> faces in front and even something very comfortable in the hope that you to their text , not forget .
that are the <unk> , who the outside of these papers .
that we other people <unk> .
but i 'm sure , there are here 's also people in the room , the way of childbirth a lonely , feel the whole life to be <unk> have , they have tried to sort of solitude and by looking at <unk> , you <unk> .
and there in this room can guarantee that people who are lonely , are , because they brought them into the other people get rid of the need to make it was contacted by death or because of a separation .
there 's using it has nothing that at that many people , also people use to show you are connected , around them are you feel very lonely .
and there are people , who have to relate to yourself lost to find any contact to stop and they 're getting very lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital loneliness .
and sit on her , contrary to the analog teaching and loneliness .
the analog teaching and loneliness is to be familiar .
that are people who are so after their opinion , it <unk> a social contacts .
that 's always had relative .

let 's just collapse upon immediately the older people a .
it 's the analog form of loneliness .

you can with hundreds of people to be connected to get away with a single human right now linked to be .
it 's at the analog loneliness to be kind of the quantity of human relationships , the missing is one of digital and loneliness to the quality of relationships .
the two forms of loneliness to be very often against <unk> .
that 's also believe that the analog loneliness is a little bit of the mold <unk> .
whereas the digital loneliness to do <unk> for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it is that <unk> that the digital loneliness to the future , you gain boils down when the the opportunities to connect to be bigger .
i do n't know , if you in 20 years that emotion that the way of loneliness is very similar to you 're going to be more loneliness to call it will .
or whether you get a newly coined the dunes .
but that are also speak , the problems of <unk> generation .
almost more than the loneliness to itself is the fear of solitude and from this fear of solitude '' are people gets to do n't ready .
<unk> , the big <unk> , also a <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
in which describes her , people do everything that 's not to be alone .

but that <unk> she did n't -- named the fear of loneliness to kick , which is to spend money .
and shop to go .
things owner .

the only problem is that 's very quickly to help me and keep going to those potions for the loneliness .
therefore we need to keep adding those things to buy us new <unk> .
i 've got 'em up the advertisement for a a <unk> panties label it .

what this at the panties , to do it , you know you know , but apparently it 's too this .
and loneliness has nothing to the <unk> to do loneliness to find under the people in the same place .
<unk> <unk> has a wonderful poem written , and there is a verse that the worst is the loneliness to <unk> .
hand on it 's heart , who knows that 's not ?
in a relationship to be waking up or the or the other while brushing her to monitor and you suddenly an awful alone a feeling , terrible lonely , to feel and the to ask , who is this person that the right ?
did i have , anything to do ?
a study of saying that turns out <unk> women around the fifty , married , with kids , feel .
proof of absent , because i now have n't know , i be the study , even invented , you 've often did i they told .
but it 's also now , no matter because it at least in studies , mostly care is , and the response time equal is that people before me <unk> .
that intuitive way to be completely obvious thing is , a <unk> .
and loneliness to <unk> is every <unk> and yet , we speak not about them .
talk just about the loneliness to having sex .
well that has probably already has experienced .
even as you <unk> is just suddenly , what do 'official ' i 'm here that the right ?
who is this person in my bed , that the right ?
this is also from loneliness that do n't necessarily going to have a deal with the quality of sexual <unk> .
but nothing to do you 've got to the quality of relationship .
she 's just always there .
we speak only did n't tell you , because we do n't look .
we talk about being right to do n't tell them in the workforce .
in the workforce is the loneliness is also <unk> than we think .
. i <unk> on <unk> <unk> and i 've seen a group of five <unk> , more i said , three people carrying the suit and two people carrying costume either .
the two men and they should entertain , the two women in a costume -- they 've entertained .

i made , i need to the scene is n't even further and execute these to do this shape of loneliness that everybody 's also have ever in his business lives has experienced , again <unk> can .
it 's the loneliness to the <unk> .
but it 's also the loneliness to the <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see , sit here , you may have some of their lives <unk> at <unk> .
in <unk> , <unk> into hotels , <unk> bars , who often have n't know who they 're actually , they do .
where they are , where you wake up .
that 's a from loneliness to talk about the n't talked up .
that 's also <unk> , like it’s loneliness than <unk> be abused can .
cue that is here for insulation .
i did n't have a <unk> told that he 's called by a client , and the said , it 's what 's <unk> happens , you can get it did you do n't imagine .
a <unk> was alone in the lunchroom .
we 've got themselves to <unk> <unk> .
and two months later , he 's also <unk> .
the loneliness to come up alone so .
it will always in touch with other feelings .
she has beautiful siblings and she 's ugly siblings .
the ugly siblings , we all .
fear , and sadness in desperation , anger and the shame .
but we should also the beautiful siblings , not forget .
the freedom to the proud of the desire that <unk> .
so therefore , my plea look at the loneliness to .

let them to and do n't be of her drive .
because there 's something much worse than the loneliness and this is the emptiness that might think of solitude and comes when you do anything to keep track .
and loneliness is part of life .
since i 'm so intensely , from loneliness thought i 've got together for me two things change .
one in my <unk> the <unk> i wo n't like a <unk> dictator since i realized , so that i only then over someone called the reason why he does n't illness , because i was thinking about losing so i the people , maybe i push it ' i lonely .
i do it 's been able , since i think of solitude and in my life accepted some people come and go to leave .
just it 's the <unk> , who do .
there too , i feel free feeding more .
people come and go to leave , they wo n't immediately to mapping , whether it turns out an encounter a friendship , it actually a partnership thrown away .
as a child i found my parents were looking embarrassing .
the look at any <unk> <unk> without working with someone a conversation that we start .
whether in the <unk> or in the economy .
every time led to see it unending talking .
as a child i found that as was embarrassing .
as an adult life i 'll be incredibly compelling <unk> that to get this openness to have .
but just since i myself up with of loneliness is bothering you 've , you get it 's me anyway , and go back to me also <unk> like to open .
you see it 's kinda lonely , his name themselves ready to do for the next occurs .
thank you .
yes , thank you .

a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .

most people would feel for the <unk> decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?

at health , we doing this kind of different .

we choose to us for the <unk> and the stands for sports .
big <unk> but big effort .
for me why are precious .
or we choose to us for the <unk> .
the stands for diet .
also very large <unk> but still very big effort .
for me why not so valuable .

you can turn to prevention and health impact , comes to a theme that as a drum from yourselves .
and this subject , which is overweight .
and this topic either overweight was in germany , long time , not an issue , about to the <unk> .
and then joined the number of obese people in germany , increasing amount .
and i asked me , there was on in the <unk> ?
why was that <unk> suddenly come up ?
and then i research and i 'm also <unk> become .
because it was n't know , <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> up germany .
and we 're going over and thicker ?
and i continue to watched .
<unk> comes <unk> up germany .
and this is overweight up .
and in working <unk> take the curve that we 'll make really in the train on .
and what will take germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how does this means .
and we 're going over and thicker ?
well , then i became one , and one <unk> .
because it was happening right .
sports , making a thick .
and of course , stuck , ' i 'm not here today , to tell them at sport , dick 's doing .
because that 's not true .
but one , we 've got together , i discovered .
the flood of being the new <unk> -- and <unk> did n't it led to say we <unk> and you’re going .
what it 's so then ?
the diet ?
and also there ai n't quite amazing recent study from the united states .
well , who have this problem with the overweight .
and they have in the <unk> <unk> introduced .
and then they soon after that look at what happens to do ?
and they 've seen , the people take it actually becoming less fat , but people taking even fewer calories , if you know , but still persists thicker bit .
and this was a paradox .
and why do it 's <unk> called .
we can explain that ?
there must not just see the body as a station that imagined .
there we have here , like this ai n't great <unk> .
and on the one comes a <unk> , to do we all the <unk> looked at the be here is incinerated .
and here 's the energy <unk> when electricity .
if we now , however , <unk> this is n't give in our power station we turned on the other use <unk> at the energy in the power station and it does , kapow .
the human body does not equal , kapow .
the way the energy stored .
and it changes in the form of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
what happened though , if we have fewer such as we 've heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> up here the energy and then makes it was only one thing to .
the <unk> so , up drastically reduces earth .
here is not that lives more redundancy .
we 're yes , mobile .
and this is what happens .
our grandparents are <unk> yet 20 kilometers to walk around .
and we come today degrees , once on one to two miles and that are the positive estimates .
there are trials , the reports of five -- until <unk> feet .
i <unk> ' you do that something <unk> with my friend mike , telling .
you giving me degrees ' the chair ?

mike 's an american .
he 's really shy , he will not talking too much .
and he was back at this trial , and sitting now here .
he 's this typical <unk> <unk> , blue jeans <unk> <unk> and he has a <unk> in the hand .
and mike , you eat fewer and fewer and take it 's now <unk> , and yet he gets over and thicker bit .
why ?
because it 's mike , sitting .

and there was put a thousand steps .

and he came up a thousand steps .
that means that mike came on the day , ten minutes on its legs .
<unk> hours and fifty minutes , i was mike , or was mike .
amongst those conditions that creates disease by itself .
and mike 's not why did dick , because he too much eating chips because as long , he grew up again and energy <unk> this , but has consumed by necessarily always use thicker , and the energy <unk> themselves .
and the first <unk> at the energy , you can see here in its <unk> .
but energy is <unk> , the left is not there .
the <unk> at some stage back in <unk> blood .
and also there is they were active and <unk> quiet and quiet in his <unk> .
so the <unk> .
so if you the energy <unk> to the blood , then talk about the physicians of stress <unk> and high <unk> .
and this <unk> , the <unk> 's like <unk> , makes all about a little black holes in this <unk> .
and a very lucky , floating if there before this whole big fat around and that <unk> just about these little wounds and we speak of <unk> or <unk> .
and now comes <unk> heart right under pressure , because now have created this blood around these tight <unk> pots pumps and we speak of pressure .
and if this pressure goes on a <unk> true , it does it 's also in the body , kapow .
and if that the heart was happening , then we call that attack .
and if that in mind has happened then we call that stroke .
and also used to die every second to attack , stroke .
this means , germany and dies every second to <unk> .
and that mike gets so not just getting sick , because he was none of sports is driving , but because he does n't even more moved .
and if you get involved , do n't know , then as if you always on the wrong place .
for example , with an issue a diet .
i have degrees ' `` yesterday we 'll make a diet , the amazon 's entered and there are coming <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , historically .
and if each book just a centimeter is thick and we did the here <unk> , we would have a 30 feet high tower , the current <unk> <unk> .
and i was the time for you read all .
and there it is inside and now that 's really important if you more energy that , so more food as they consume , you will be thick .
and if you less energy that , when they consume , you will be thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why we need to <unk> books ?
this room only one thing to .
that need is obviously , huge , but <unk> is to do n't help .
because why <unk> of diet , a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet is , and more compassionate lifestyle .

what it stays locked up after five or seven weeks ?
nothing .

so we get them off now at any new diet , at any new <unk> ask ourselves and you like that their day-to-day , your lifestyle to integrate .
yes or no ?
and if you know , and then <unk> .
and if no , they let 's just stay .
because if the end of <unk> , it 's pure waste .
there are the habits , the ability to decide whether we do you get sick or stay healthy .
there are the bad habits , who get sick to do .
and there are the good behavior of us healthy way .
and if mike comes in the mirror , look , then he look inside this result of his to interact with a lifestyle .
if mike , in the mirror , look , then he look inside your everyday habits .
and if mike comes in the mirror , look , and frankly , to itself is , then he look as well , where he holds this is .
because when he wrote down bad habits , as good that then it 's just in the direction of disease , traveling .
and if mike comes in the direction to moving towards wellness and direction of its goals , if you can see its dreams , then you have n't meet once his life <unk> .
then he need to do more bad habits , as bad .
and b <unk> habits , mike 's also a great example , that the person , a weird animal is .
mike 's example , managed to movement is completely different from his day <unk> by any way to the driving had an escalator , using , everyone to lift , using .
and night , he sits down <unk> on the couch , and somehow knots were back to shift coming .
so he turns into his <unk> ride into your gym where do sort of an escalator , up what i 'm ... transforming se a paradox is , and then becomes like this ai rat getting out on a band <unk> , he could get a way back to shift coming .
and my grandpa , would you just <unk> as you .
the was <unk> and the way that did n't .
the would have said , sport is for people who do n't move .
and somehow has been right .

is strictly taken if we now this <unk> lifestyles after two hours of sports and make a day .
now if only wish , but much easier to the vibrating back down to find where we 'll have lost .
the ground .
and therefore <unk> ' i do today to a shift to invite you .
maybe you know , they also the situation , you drive the night , we 'll quickly go shopping and the bitter , turns out in the front row — no place , free is .
and remind you see how we 're wired for this <unk> to us is .
we always wants to the shortest due to go .
we plan our homes , so we the <unk> ways that .
we plan our whole lives so that we the <unk> ways that , but that brings us are going to do n't go , where we <unk> .
but in a very different direction .
so we get them down to focus on the <unk> activate and the vibrating back there are finding , where they degrees comes up .
i <unk> ' for example , to participate in the trajectory .
and i 'm the only , the way up and down and up and down running and everybody else was very much .
but if i may have time i 'm going <unk> ' i went into the time for me .
then <unk> ' i went into the movement of that 's just like yourselves today lies .

<unk> steps .
that are about three times 10 minutes , translated it .
and b <unk> <unk> steps , if you 're doing today , every day <unk> steps more and then that means that you end of the day , twelve gram of fat not in your body <unk> .
this may be relatively little sound .

that we 're not in our bodies have .
and you give me degrees ' time that , i <unk> ' would always <unk> .
the americans are going into the crazy , which is so what here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
are made of on me four pounds .
just to show you 'll see what happened there with these little parts .
and if that the effect is from this perspective , and they do , just happened , if you really in an active life to start .
and these <unk> who bring them down to focus on every day in their day-to-day .
once they do <unk> steps per day you arrived there are going to walk you virtually all <unk> it .

then they came along the <unk> that <unk> .
you will be even faster and stronger .
but do with your health , no longer independent of sports .

because that most important that most important to do that they 're going on every day as a lifestyle .
and i <unk> of on an active lifestyle <unk> .
and for me , it 's now more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a <unk> this on a clear that decision based on for that life and for myself .
because i think about health has n't get to do what you 're doing , or do you .
but health has got to do what we want to do .
and therefore <unk> handle today , i just another idea for them .
decide they 're now just yet for that the best .
and down now you can also how it goes .
one step .
thank you .
<unk> how it 's a leonardo da vinci , actually done on the incredible , <unk> kind and breaks the world around with eyes to see ?
and by introducing yourself as far on this <unk> , to his time , just simply inconceivable , inconceivable , was ?
we could be such as well ?
well that maybe what do <unk> to do ?
and how can take the power and confidence for our future draw ?
we start with looking at some point on with the question what we understand that actually melt down innovation ?
yeah .
technology and invention of research and development , even the official <unk> the federal government has the title <unk> the federal government .
so you know about me , right .
well that 's all great .
and we can do right to be proud and be grateful that we <unk> in such a lot of wells for that our technologies around the world 're needed to let 's good to go .
that we make a kind of extraordinary , unique new wealth 've developed .
but look like 's the future from ?
those challenges that come because there as a society towards us to ?
and who cares for himself because there to the major environmental and social engineering challenges ?
so <unk> ' , it seems to somehow it mattered to be .
kind of the rule .
so the economy care to the environmental challenges , because of entrepreneurs sprung up big effort with the we get productivity and efficiency of increase .
and that the world better to do the find out in the nonprofit entities , unite , and <unk> and the need to actually , what companies , so the main <unk> course , then to the damage the least capitalist in the economy to eliminate them .
at least <unk> to fix .
but who says , because that we all that when they were separated at need ?
how about it because if we 're <unk> by ai social and cultural dimension that up ?
if technological innovation in the same as cultural innovation are
if economic and innovation , the same as social innovation are
if it to <unk> leaders , thinking and doing sent to self-assemble with the solution large environmental and social engineering challenges ?
if you realize very different previously unknown forces <unk> and if it to <unk> a very different , and fair <unk> been going forward ?
because he did this ?
both sides were like corporations , right ?
can that work ?
you may be asking yourself to deal .
now this , we know , as a contradiction considered .
fortunately , there 's encouraging examples .
muhammad yunus , it with his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh creepy , much longer cares about the poverty , there <unk> .
and interestingly , too much more in the direct <unk> to from , the federal <unk> done it .
and he has <unk> as entrepreneurs , i must have begun to do the <unk> <unk> get .
at the opportunity to notice me a i <unk> ' they still with anyone familiar to do .
allow , not allowed me introduce <unk> <unk> .

and super trained , i did , but also his original ideals saved .
and yes , totally <unk> .
i love the absolutely key insight .
and if you to see if you think , oh really , which the offspring , there we need to our future does n't worry .
yes , right after the studying it 's got off somewhere here 's begun to work in one of our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that he also just fine .
that 's how to become totally and there 's also very successful .
and yet , something out there at that in him .
so he was wondering , there 's not even more that way to me out ?
so this is this entrepreneurial , he says , then the time .
<unk> 're miserable doing <unk> .
and that liked him too .
and that he loved ones that <unk> .
so the right there 's also the <unk> , the did he did n't recognized .
so not that he carried personal if you know , , from <unk> tells him the point out .
and there of in the center at the t , three n , the did n't meet .
so even more he was surprised when of him up at <unk> personally was introduced .
when mister <unk> .


and the two people , then plummeted <unk> found .
and they always <unk> met .
how about it because if we just try to put those conversations from the two times <unk> ?
yes , mister <unk> , like this was because again , right .
what 's right now the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> company ?
that i did not fully understood .

so the name says , go to know already .
conventional agriculture markets , conventional products conventional customers , conventional structures , there 's a sophistication .
and you can also quite closely projections are committed to give , where does this huge entities , <unk> .
and look at ai ai <unk> , even if the quite neat name is that too .
what 's because then we are actually a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you <unk> been so one is it ai n't guarantee it 's just not the small copy one company .
it 's something very different .
it has happened over a radically different character .
because it has to be nothing <unk> .
no <unk> customers , no <unk> <unk> , it 's known .
by police officer is a <unk> a <unk> organization of the purpose to serve a business to go , finding , to develop this is profitable it 's kind of course , but particularly <unk> is up and then we scale up .
and you will piss you understand that it , of course , so <unk> organization of a different different ways , there , very different <unk> , very different ways .
yes , this is to me clarify .
but after about searching we because essentially ?


this means <unk> .
how you know your business success <unk> and after the <unk> your entire life <unk> did .
oh no .
but really <unk> ?
what do you because if you with the beginning rates , your <unk> money did what 's because after your <unk> ?
so <unk> you take a career as <unk> <unk> it ?
what if you do with your commitment , as i know you ?
and furthermore , we 're going to look like , you 've the <unk> on .
so the statistics about <unk> give any <unk> perspective , because seventy percent <unk> are few years back afterward , in a much worse financial situation when imagining its base of los angeles .
money is always that 's a successful company , and a good <unk> company .
when money is a <unk> for an enterprise actions .
and it is the foundation all economic <unk> .
but it 's never that target is a company .
yes , then is that target ?
the company ?


and when i do all this does n't got 'em , this as i can be doing search of which i do n't know what i look for all right ?
so that makes me not feel good .

yes , <unk> welcome to the enterprise .
but i 've got 'em just maybe what for thee .
one thread .
so the is yes , have <unk> , almost a secret .
successful <unk> by generation to generation <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , or how to tell you today ?
<unk> made ' i , <unk> ?
so we 'll be always <unk> them .

so it helps them . i
i made of on , i can you one of leave .
okay .
yes , thank you , mister <unk> .
but there was very well , you ask . put
this , 'cause you 'll try to remember one of the most important an enterprise qualities , is generally speaking to ask .
we can the first one after another go through , that i 'd better understand ?
so the first is what i am here , and i want to do this happen ?
yes , <unk> , there 's go <unk> what happens in your enemy that about you move beyond that 's bigger than you ?
what <unk> you the world ?
what people a lot of if you with you to work ?
what you 're willing to give you ?
what are your pipes , maybe i 'm not unconscious <unk> ?
why is this is important thing to see ?
because that are also your business enterprise <unk> .
and how we have this of learning ?
if you a ship to build you want to get <unk> not the men together bits of work a member of them on wood to collect , but to teach them , profound yearning for the region , unending supply the ocean .
yes , well .
so then <unk> i let me the next questions on .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
which means that ?

colorful <unk> in detail , <unk> but i <unk> ' walk in front of information that if you <unk> , you do n't do then there is going on your window vocabulary you know .
know you actually the story with the pink and elephants ?
now looking at a .
not ?
<unk> .

<unk> you have no turning pink and elephants ago .
okay ?
it does it 's right ?
so no turning pink and elephants .
you understand ?
no turning pink and elephants .
you see ?
so it 's us , if we let 's put your focus on this , we do n't want .
what 's actually the only way ?
there 's about <unk> ?
yes , when you <unk> ' boy : that you want .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the <unk> on <unk> .
but <unk> go check out of rough ago .
the way , just thinking to mind you <unk> but <unk> it ?
i did you 're trying to be brought .
<unk> time , if you the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> lord smith .
<unk> ?


i <unk> called a glass of hits the master <unk> .
i do <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .

<unk> <unk> <unk> smith .


<unk> come <unk> .


and <unk> look like , go from ?
is you what i notice ?
i did something changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower is too .
okay .
so , then we can look like , you 've got to have a look where the bear -- stayed is .
and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> lord smith .
<unk> ?


i <unk> called a glass of hits the master <unk> .
i do <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .

<unk> <unk> <unk> smith .
and <unk> , how it 's telling ?
so , i remember , i was also be shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i first time this , it 's got 'em .
i thought it can we did n't have that would be .
and more shocked when i 've got me through the head left is it might be that i actually the entire time to the way through the area over ?
through my life .
and okay , i get it does mean totally new sense .
and keep up there , the immediate <unk> to prevent that we that from our perception and our <unk> undercover <unk> need .
but it because now actually start ?
what <unk> ' i was , and <unk> ' i 'm from ?
and therefore <unk> , <unk> your perception <unk> somewhere <unk> to be able to it ai n't other major entrepreneurial quality .
well , yes , thank you then we get it would have the next question .
how i could actually to my goal , right ?
so , that , i think this ai n't good question .

yes , <unk> , there 's about it ai n't good news for thee .
that 's got easier to fall when you that might never known to get .

now , naturally .
you 're going to do n't feel more than that a brainstorming , in your occurred that things down to pull out .
that are then these famous <unk> that you woke up under the shower , you 've done .
and yet this ai n't question i recommend you 're the spot , look at your good order to whom you integrate could about who you get advice of questions could get there are able to get input , as long lens with your home to get .
and you 've also a huge role model .
the <unk> have this is terrific <unk> .
<unk> di <unk> , if the longer going to know , one of its <unk> join in florence .
for lunch at the famous big table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , the bankers , as traders -- engineers , architects and he has this ai n't very intense <unk> cared .
but not in our modern mind , where it 's drum at night , yes , who designed sits down through ?
who 's right ?
but rather subtle ones that goes out of these different <unk> things are the way on any kind and down from one of them alone could have to figure can .
good at the next question is accounted for the concrete forward and i doing ?
<unk> 's to move sheep 's successful entrepreneur in the reason , very simple .
instead , has to plan , and management and forth and actually do you 're just on the next step .
because what you do in the area of uncertainty and also do ?
but the run this very determined and all the consequence out .
and if there goes something that it was well , dan , they looking at a stop <unk> different step .
and even when the big , colorful <unk> <unk> it was then there 's a stop this ai n't other .
therefore it 's important that you , you so what 's clear .
this gives you the inside of security .
and the rest of how we 're all going to learn ?
although we do that does n't know , and it even though nobody has said ?
<unk> tells you 're also <unk> at the children .
so , this <unk> learn to search and this <unk> <unk> searching it 's also , this is fun thing in a company is happening in a <unk> .
and that 's exactly like this <unk> against the uncertainty of us forever , so anxious power .
yes , thanks ! mister <unk> .
so this sounds out of it 's pretty good at .
but i do n't know so , at me the company , i made of on there must be many more of bosses change that 's something happens .
and ourselves to set up here in germany , there 's always kind of these general ; mood .
and i made of on , there would have the politicians 'll take care that does n't change .
okay my boy , come up with .
how come here -- went down to the water .
what do you , many people can you change ?
10 ?
10 thousand ?
ten million ?
look here , down .
when you see ?
now , the .
this is kind of the you change that moment , the you really change the foods .

you think sure a beautiful words and huge role models , but how to this stuff more convenient to work ?





so i mean , if you go into you already happening is that comes to go at least worth it .
yeah well .
mister <unk> thank you .
and do you really to me that helps on my enterprise way ?
yes , right .
and <unk> you , especially those two things .
first time the eighth place on the clarity of your inner <unk> that 's going to your enterprise what will .
because that determines your perception .
and to the second eighth place on your inner differently about your own face .
having <unk> you like the other people who you have a behavior .
the future , we do it just then when we our own change perceptions .
<unk> you to figure this ?
yes , i <unk> ' point .
thanks ! mister <unk> well then .
all good <unk> <unk> .
yes .
what do you think of our <unk> ?
nice .
indeed , or , <unk> ?
and how we hold it 's because now actually with this <unk> ?
this is a new <unk> ?
i mean , yeah .
clearly .
whereas i particularly the <unk> see .

and this is , the <unk> really represents .
a <unk> from some potions for the euphoria .
and no , new <unk> , <unk> .
now that 's the <unk> .
the right now <unk> a long in the famous name <unk> .
by robert , bosch , about <unk> <unk> <unk> zeppelin -- or <unk> or you all the hot .
let 's just walked into that spirit new to animate them .
and anybody might be yes , from our <unk> next step of leonardo of our time .
you see the right , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it would be so intuitive , that i 'm wrong with kids and their future i 'm concerned , because after they 're going into the kids in our future .
instead is that of view the i the most of time <unk> .
i spend a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , have my father and i think this program <unk> , entrepreneurship , for prisoners , crowdfunded edition .
we technically qualify <unk> entrepreneurial , that means you can step after the custody , either casually we do or even after their <unk> easier to the workplace , the they actually , you can hold .
why <unk> i 'm going on chairs being used to <unk> , those who 've failed over the big mistake i did ?
our program is a much not easy to understand how the importance of people who care for children .
and frankly , i wish i thought that the <unk> the last place in the universe is , which i work would .
do you know , is the most critical lack of a factor in the kid with the people we 've been working with ?
we 've figured out there are positive models as often the male positive role models .
and if you think about , why it 's having <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> there are often it 's because it 's remember that the father 's no sensible things work has to him drink that he 's the drugs and consumed or that he asked ourselves in prison is sitting .
and if you got a seven-year-old child 's about what he comes from his life make a did he 'd probably does it 's better idea , as a different lives might look , because he was no better models that .
and he <unk> his father moved .
i <unk> calls them , martin imagine .
martin 's <unk> our program .
his father was raging alcoholic drink and made the entire family that are living hell .
when he was 12 , which is his mother died , and he and be a little baby brother he had to home .
there was the <unk> the great .
he was shy and <unk> and thus recognizes that perfect victims .
and to the day as being a little baby brother and to a soccer game so roughly <unk> down there is that this floor that stayed .
there was burned , martin examines the first time the <unk> through , he went on the enemy off and not respond to .
and down , that day he was left respects .
and so it went off .
and violence , matched by now on to his life like at his father .
how it goes well , <unk> that i just described , so , next ?
after the child left out of adolescence are lots of unemployed or have <unk> .
they 're not much more than your illegal activities and their <unk> <unk> .
and then they will someday , with people in jail locked down there 's just going to their thoughts about this same beams that we do n't have better models are .
about what , they think , think these people together , when it together in prison for your chairs ?
mostly about , not very good .
and they 're getting better criminal activity in <unk> .
they sell and then have drugs on a higher level and plan before the custody , where they were looking at the custody <unk> could .
and that leads to put in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .
this means , germany will each of judgment on the second criminals to jail .
then there , but also people in prison , who really change our mind .
but also these people wear a <unk> the broad forehead .
and there is <unk> .
and everywhere , where they go through this is of their first identity .

this problem which we stand .
how we 're trying to to solve ?
which this trait , they think , bringing lots <unk> with ?
they will be surprised .
there are more entrepreneurial skills .
who 's a <unk> that 's built it definitely no idea of <unk> , of <unk> and of <unk> .
the only thing with the subject <unk> it 's a little <unk> otherwise , if only did n't meet in prison landed .
those qualities we would like for something positive use .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison , three <unk> .
we are the fundamentals of entrepreneurship and the economy .
each of cooperators , carve out its own <unk> and anybody takes a comprehensive <unk> part .
and then to accompany the people to even after the custody at the <unk> , the <unk> at the <unk> your personal relations and also at one of <unk> .
what for the founding go out of our program to stand out ?
it 's a wide range , from <unk> the crime agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> at <unk> .

<unk> leaders , talent and technological illusion of fast enough money to have him a very early to trade , cocaine seduced .
he had been fun thing , businesses to run .
he 's then <unk> first time , arrested .
and it into custody it was n't really striking .
quite the opposite .
he says , ourselves financially today , he did was placed into custody ready .
<unk> is he then the second time , convicted of urban dweller .
and he was then only a therapy , and then at <unk> .
and there , he did he was like to be great leaders , talent for something <unk> can use .
he 's in september the ages of prison and bred it , then october <unk> research agency for <unk> formed .
the agency -- just pretty neat , he can now of life .
he has evolved very good <unk> <unk> .
he 's happening here with me .
who would like to define you want you 're talking about him up .
now we 'll go back to martin , which i can start telling away .
martin 's got up his childhood a training exercise , chef <unk> and ended up in his spare time in the <unk> <unk> .
and there , alcohol , and drugs , there on the agenda are used to be a cycle . pretty quickly started .
he worked in parallel when the dj , and when <unk> .
twenty years , he ran this lifetime .
and he says , today , that he did with this lifestyle to be not <unk> confidence <unk> it .
one day injured by someone at one <unk> such that he then a convicted .
he took a <unk> part and that <unk> there 's really his life changed .
he learned , like him to more force to more success and to be the quality could come up without his <unk> to make juice or without drugs to consume .
and he was from your insights from so excited that he had decided that wants , he likes to pass .
and he did part of the <unk> be .
that 's unclear ] .
he works well since scarce , two years to us and <unk> our participants across their way in the direction of freedom , because he knows , ourselves that to get really change want , and if you the right tools to remind you the get that much more possible is when you 're oftentimes i want .
the basis of these successes are the way people like you .
people , who contributed to jail for coming in the way as external , events to us to come to our participants do their <unk> , at your personal plans to base hospital .
that are our speaking , the <unk> talks in our class often , that are students who <unk> do , <unk> of <unk> change .
and that are our great mentors , which our participants and immediately after the custody accompany me .
and also these people take a lot of our program with .
an example .
we do on the events , an exercise , who <unk> calls .
we glue off in the middle of space a big <unk> our participants , standing on the one and our <unk> stand on the other .
and i was somewhat different questions .
and every time , if anyone in space that question , `` yes , answered , and get it looked at the line ago .
and here it turns out what we all together we have , whether we within the prison sit or outside .
but also , where the differences within .01 .
and an example , class , where the differences within which is the question .

standing there 's typically a lot of our participants in front lines on the line and very few of our <unk> .
a question that i 'd go ahead of us all together , the <unk> ' i love you ask .
why i 'll ask you for every once every morning .
maybe we can put some light given in the audience .
i can see them .
it at all .
terrific .
thank you .
i <unk> ' you 're going on a question , and if you that question , `` yes , the answer to put them back to go , otherwise would remain just stand .
this is sort of our line that we 're going on them .
i have in my life of illegal done things , which i 'd be punished , they can be done it 's not .
if you that question with it 's worth putting yourself , please .
to count , drunk driver threats to be .

to count , it 's the seat is not quite right order to have .
okay .
and it matters too low vision , maybe each of labor to do n't always happens correctly signed up to have .
all right .
most of the seats .
we have a few angel in space .
this is a wonderful , there i 'm happy .
thank you , you 're allowed to all over again , sit down .
this question , if that we went on the events to ask , come our <unk> very often held up <unk> .
and many will also clear , as luck , you may have had .
happiness with the parents ' happiness with the environment , of them were growing , with the friends , but fortunately came out that they may not always getting caught you have been if you do the edge of <unk> -- well , moreover did .
what are the results of our jobs ?
sixties percent of our alumni from even from within <unk> days after their <unk> a mobile workplace .
this is rapidly moving fast .
<unk> percent they already here independently .
one third of donor cycles in the past year we were <unk> .
and our <unk> survival is seven percent .
i had it already told the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany , of <unk> percent of us .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> per year to taxpayers <unk> euros .
and it 's a beautiful <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> of seven percent of us a <unk> of typically <unk> percent for a saving means .
when my father and i was dating this <unk> started writing system , we are quite frankly , stood by a pretty much for quite nuts , held in charge .
i was my fancy <unk> in a big businesses are abandoned .
but i have to tell you , i in my life are a <unk> the work .
we encourage our participants took so , taking responsibility .
responsibility , in their life 's happened and especially if responsibility for taking , in their lives will happen .
did n't go to hide , nothing to <unk> .
because that leads to a whole new social confidence and allows it also the people up again , trust the trees .
and therefore it makes me , especially happy and pride and when our participants were laid off their way to report .

film .
so i was convicted to two years , and eight months , because of dangerous <unk> .
i was <unk> against this <unk> to three years , and 10 months convicted .

so , i no judgment of received two years , because of dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation , <unk> has actually lost complete life changed .
and what for me was important , these <unk> , who made up .
because there was my yes , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't <unk> , <unk> ' i close to say yes .

i had the perspective discovered . i 've come forward , watched .
and goes with a very different kind of consciousness and confidence from the custody out .
so far we had more <unk> without a fixed these goals and then is you to be time , something <unk> .
with the wrong people together and that i 'm not anymore .

this the biggest problem , because then it 's automatically <unk> , that you go back in the old <unk> coming .
you know , you know anything else .
by this <unk> individual <unk> , however , there are offered it has to me just all my thinking about me , ourselves , about other , over the berlin interacting with issues , over the of interacting with society that has to me just as those 20 weeks , is completely different beast .
i 've been <unk> of my first woman in divorce .
and since <unk> six months , live , ' i reconnect with her personality .
so that means that we have a new relationship started .
and because i found myself among other way through this whole <unk> and many other things change it got 'em .
so much did i already done .
i 'm with my family back in plain the education started .
so i work today in my <unk> , <unk> ' i say .
i do 'official ' catcher 's a <unk> to <unk> .
you have that actually acknowledge that 's very , very many people are the fact , such as my mentors who 's also about this time , moreover , and actually going to be yes , i do n't know , <unk> engagement , beyond the people to support .
i 'm grateful that they 're on the idea that came here are that they do .
i 'm grateful that they do it 's largely working with certainty the difficulty was pulled it , and i 'm extremely grateful that i was part of his age .
these include course , all the people , the support , the financial markets were .
i came out with many people at the events was speaking , and the me over and confirmed that 's good , that go mad .
and there 's not going to push ' i 's also do .
and do n't tell ' i thank you .
they come up with us to jail .
each of you did something that we need to be .
if you our participants do their <unk> base , if you as the <unk> to come from us whether they in the frame of a financial support people are .
if you our program in a new <unk> want to wear , quite <unk> issue .
you 're talking to keep up .

and look forward to take this conversation with them .
thank you .
<unk> i do <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> in nepal <unk> .
in a time in the i do something <unk> was .
there is that makes you know about those things .
who <unk> promote it .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in the monastery , here .


anyway , i was <unk> also <unk> .

whereas this , i really of <unk> talk to .
and not from real problems .
my problem was going <unk> and brought me pretty accurate <unk> like my life of millions of wars , 30 years will look .
it was <unk> .

to be very least to express .
basically , i had a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
a living as private .
i did n't come up the <unk> way to continue ?
back to go for me just lazy way ?
or what if i mean <unk> again , new to throw this ?
and look , ' what happens .
what would stand on me wait .
this was so , the mind .
i was in this time , free <unk> at one <unk> .
so as <unk> .
the <unk> was for me , despite <unk> the absolute <unk> .
you <unk> free the world , they live in very good hotels and <unk> this country on a very <unk> kind and the way .
<unk> but occasionally , very <unk> countries .
and developing countries where it sure anymore to see , and say , i 'm thinking about <unk> villages , that’s <unk> local people who , though they have nothing , so much of happiness and joy <unk> .
just by these images and to cliché and lives , but a <unk> kind of the way .
and this was it was for me after a while the key .
i was that what i did a little bit .
to <unk> .
moreover , i found a little bit of <unk> of me about a country to write to judge that i really do n't really know .
that i wanted to change .
i wanted to let 's define you .
to <unk> papers to write your .
and to my personal interest to be breastfeeding .
how you 're learning you much better know ?
by having experimented with the lives .
at the lives , at them home .
not in the hotel .
by you with the challenges and the problems of people engaged .
and by having experimented with the people who works .
at least was that the answer that i 'm looking at this question to be able to .
and that i wanted to do .

i wanted a contribution to afford .
something good deal .
and emotion , has to me , especially in an <unk> further , it increases .
i was done before quite often in developing world , nepal 's got me just a particularly touched .
until <unk> ruled from a 10 year-old civil war of not just universal and orphans , but also lots of economic and social problems and left .
with an annual death per capita from <unk> euros of nepal is that the poorest country in asia .
and counting to continue to speak at the wars , the poorest countries around the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
nearly one fifth of the population suffer just malnutrition .
forty percent of adults do n't read and writing .

in the i do something to change the molecule .
and drum stood up my return of nepal and my decision in terms .
i quit my job .
and <unk> me at the aid .
and i <unk> ' now , just an excerpt of the answer <unk> that i on my <unk> received .

it 's here to a serious <unk> at <unk> international <unk> company .
and not a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> the stop at once in nepal is life , i want , and a funding of their <unk> addiction .
hi ?
it 's left ?
my <unk> was really seriously , we meant , and good .
at least i thought that .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .

and i ' walk away a quite profound emotional response to write .
and fortunately , never <unk> .
instead they did i put into an intense an emotion , took about what good <unk> to do .
i 've been used as a motor , around my own business for starting .
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> walked back <unk> <unk> .
a company that basically exactly that offers , then i looked for college .
they are dying of creating a country unlike a chimpanzee traveling .
the way , a country right to meet .
it adds up with the people were there 's life and you can work .

<unk> you can actually in two words , apart .
so karma , and <unk> .
this means much , like a place on your good so karma can gather together .
in which you do good can do .

but it 's not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use the tourism , as a tool for sustainable development .
<unk> we use <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and unsustainable tourism .


but they travel any differently .
they live at <unk> .

social engagement .
and <unk> .
and getting involved at our participants and according qualification , and interests in various projects .

because just the infrastructure , lacking .
let everyone else we can build sustainable food projects to increase .
we can bring to sustainable food projects <unk> and funding .
we 're funded us so a hundred percent of self .
are not going on donating to rely on .

have started , we our work <unk> in nepal .
<unk> year we have our effort on uganda <unk> .
and now after about four years turned out of us now i got married and my husband and i also are living a team was a <unk> question .
we go over the <unk> away from here ?
or if we even greater than thinking ?
if we the <unk> still continues to go ?
if , we 're developing not just a social engagement and deep field trips i 'm looking for development of his wholeness is beyond what ?
and then also the individual <unk> integrate this ?
or more or specialty individual <unk> .
that would essentially a new one extra company .
a company , this is to the company , your attention .
with other <unk> but the same philosophy , how <unk> .
we want this ?
i was the next question .

sure that we want to this .
we love social entrepreneur and their creative companies .
because we 'll be ticking .
because we the same language to talk .
because we the same dreams were dreaming .
because we the challenges to understand .
and therefore we have in this year <unk> one sister , given .
<unk> .
and <unk> conducive to creative companies in its development and <unk> <unk> that we can really extraordinary people to support .

so <unk> the personal social and <unk> development of <unk> contain .
and <unk> of the <unk> prepare .
the there at <unk> also again .
a base of the next to a meaningful <unk> another <unk> it .
he shows that in relatively short on where you know , or where you <unk> .
where you might even the psyche , prejudice , it .
where you might be a scalable , is , to <unk> in thinking .
and he shows a way , what good you really well , is .
it takes a his strength of eyes .
getting the creativity , the sudden , terrific is .
or getting rid of serenity and who were going to be detected .
of serenity and do n't assume that you do n't change .
and the force , things to change that you can change .
and you very much change .
already in very short time .
we know that .
an example of them .
that are <unk> rose <unk> , lydia and <unk> .
that are five quite amazing women from uganda .
with <unk> <unk> and talent .
they <unk> beautiful , <unk> <unk> years .
and the years happened was nothing .
because they simply no market for it had .
because they did n't know , as you the quality can improve .
because you nobody has said , which design , maybe in the question arises .
we wanted to these women help .
and it 's why in this year , a <unk> formed .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
products on the people of poverty is .
that you a salary increase .
a future will enable .
we 're yesterday with our <unk> to , zeray .

a <unk> <unk> of thousands <unk> of our women .
the sales that brings them not just for a year , an income .
but allows us as well , this project that very much bigger one way .
this first <unk> 's sort of social <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a .
so you 'll support group wants , can this one with the purchase a chain that make any other , he can do with us along straight in the project , travel .
he can be able to the women and travel to actively <unk> .
long-term investments we 're not only five women 's a job . give you know which fifty or a hundred .
and that 's not just in uganda , but in nepal and other <unk> , which we <unk> work .
now is , but this <unk> just a project from our new integrated cycle on projects .
we 're working in all the core areas .
in the area <unk> <unk> walked for health and <unk> walked back <unk> .
because the work in just a field just too low is .
what happens with the children when women who work ?
right .
therefore we have in this year for nepal and in uganda , two <unk> centre , crowdfunded edition .

and so that makes more sense , as any one project for themselves .
participants , we place , and according qualification into the various projects .
the exact ways to surrender themselves will always been in the joint effort .
and great way i want to give more now , right on a voyage .
and then , i urge you the eyes to close .
<unk> ' boy : imagine if you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on a <unk> dining room .
and they 're happy , and tired .
you 've just with your <unk> to lunch is eaten .
there <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
inside here 's a pleasant to warm .
you <unk> out of the window .
and you ought to kids in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet <unk> the sand on .
you <unk> on your <unk> .
but also on them onto a thin <unk> dust .
the kids were laughing .
and calls for fun your behalf .
you <unk> you 're all you have not only <unk> call .
<unk> .
you know what does n't like to postpone it 's .
but soon , you going to stand up .
and the <unk> , the arrival , the children , ran , <unk> .
the end of the street is a big redwood .
here you going to touch with lydia meet .
in the meadow , sitting in the shadow of tree to you like the new designs of their <unk> repeat .
how do you with my hands and feet to talk .
later come back that the other women lead .
they smile , you <unk> on .
until you with your english class <unk> .
under the tree .
in free .
incredible that 's here yet the internet , there .
tomorrow <unk> you back with your coach .
now <unk> you .
the exchange is every so valuable .
it 's also very much time after german , to talk .
you 're hearing about music .
and that <unk> of <unk> .


you 're comfortable and happy .
you the eyes , again on doing .
and all of us can the <unk> to hit on something new <unk> .
or at least for a short time that cube , but i thought were going to throw away .
and to look what happens .
thank you .

i <unk> ' away with the lights are really well , but perhaps want to someone you log .
down here <unk> ' i want .
two .
here is going <unk> ' i 'm not , but definitely the down here are already have two , that 's beautiful , we are already have to <unk> .
i 've got 'em , which is also a building occupied and it changes the villa mountain in east of the city <unk> .
that 's the building .
together with 20 other people did i the villa out in the last summer , six months to be occupied .
and so stuck , ' i 'm here tonight before them .
well , and that might be some of you say .
what 's also ?
<unk> there 's such a lot .
but i want it quickly explain .
oh , what , you are occupying now the villa along ?
and you <unk> then in park or how ?
just a small sample of the to , friends and colleagues have asked when they have experienced that i was part of an initiative , i <unk> ' to , something <unk> names <unk> am .
all we expected that we will seamlessly in the number of <unk> <unk> had .

and turn against the privatization of a villa out to stop protesting .
but whoever taught me , if you know , you know that 's not my kind of <unk> .

what we see , is a sign of <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space of you privately simply is , and therefore , for many people do n't available there , <unk> ' i do n't say , but not in public hand is and therefore we are being used to be , as public spaces may use .

and we wanted to another <unk> tell you .
we 've been a <unk> team and that have i 'm very quickly see , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas of architecture , planning , social -- , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design process music , photography <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
obviously the same as well , at different social and cultural and personal <unk> .

and have allowed us , at different skills , but also look at various networks <unk> .
and creative part , living unconventional solutions in the <unk> , the then we did it , <unk> to realize .
we 've actually navigated to the villa out to occupy .
however , i went to go for us about that we the villa with stories and ideas to occupy .
we have to take the memories and where he asked .
and from those memories and images out is trying to be improved outlook for the villa out to develop .
when he was let 's important that the process which is a constructive and make sure .
us as an initiative , we have always been <unk> platform and when <unk> terms .
like <unk> a <unk> and emotional , sit-ins in and became muddled up and after a <unk> .
on the experiences that we think we 've done , <unk> ' i tonight is responsive .
every city has <unk> places .
the a neighborhood a face to give .
in many cases reported this is though <unk> and <unk> and be in the result of citizens , strangers are places are perceived slights .
they are the deaths from places , city because they send it often not the equivalent , we 're in public space is expected .
so for example that we <unk> have to <unk> have .
in this , but also the fact , public , the urban places we neglected and this will often <unk> .

what 's also with me to do n't like this is some questions like some outside of questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places , giving our town , not just a face .
no .
they are the social sites beyond the city , of our <unk> life is happening .
so to knit , we 're often the first <unk> ties to our neighbors , if we have happened on the way shopping together .


it will form friendships , sometimes .
what do with certainty that there 's a sense of community .
ever more profound encounters , i 've taken in such a public space , so you can handle on the more faster and the more likely , you have this community .
and when i 'm not <unk> , then , you know that , you think of anonymity basically a big city called .
we stood up front of two challenges .
we can look at the citizens of consciousness , accountability and engagement for their neighborhood woken up or in <unk> also <unk> be .
how to protest in the creation be transformed ?
how can make reasonable criticism in new ideas to be transformed ?
a protest against the privatization , and <unk> this <unk> <unk> places and criticism , against the growing and actually not <unk> <unk> arrival of the same places .
and ask yourself now , which they sit here , once they beat the newspaper , and read the show text .
i love <unk> and citizens , we invite you a we want you three kinds of options for the <unk> the <unk> imagine that have a previously was carefully <unk> <unk> designed it .
they 're allowed in the following off the idea of another version choose .
and the variation in with the most <unk> will <unk> implemented .
they would go ?
would anyone from them to this event go ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it once more awesome .
there ai n't have , <unk> .
they ca <unk> , like this future , the way .
and again , it sounds once so brilliantly by the first moment .
i try to grab me nonetheless , in an explanation .
and it , because i of view 'm they ca n't really join or pick up or shape , <unk> .
so one , because the classic <unk> often much too late <unk> .
that means mostly , they have any chance to really your suggestions to make or the basic alternatives to argue , but there are actually have this ai design and they ca <unk> have to decide whether they <unk> or <unk> in an urban green plants .
or , like a friend of road said , what color the trash can have an example .
second one explanation about classical <unk> rarely go about information and vote out .
so you think the three <unk> varieties .
we have here is what that we want to show you , and they must then you can vote .
the frustration and <unk> are often the following what i kind understandable , right now .
i certainly want to any decision about <unk> or <unk> meeting when i actually rather ai <unk> route , instead <unk> <unk> had been .
it goes , but also different .
although we have the <unk> the existing <unk> lot of notes cost has we ultimately more <unk> experience .
what we experience to be picked up and that i want to take <unk> share .
i want it can pass on others have initiatives , at other projects , but also , especially at the <unk> and at the politics .
because the area of those who are , the kinds <unk> actually run along and the really responsible for such manufacturing processes are .
if you know that this is really interested in an involvement in , how it so often <unk> and he emphasizes that will then we need and then we need the <unk> new <unk> .
but finally <unk> ' i but also making them , the right now this room .
and it 's why , because i <unk> very important to think .
i stop making it was important is that they go , and i want them with our device to encourage , the <unk> another opportunity to give
and i <unk> at me , they all , because they are the ones that looked at the <unk> a new <unk> demand it can .

had their willingness to take a dialogue in the gravitational field .
in <unk> meet as practitioners at <unk> , citizens on <unk> and different interests of applause ends .
what we see , is a <unk> , which we invited them .
what we see , are some <unk> and <unk> in conversation with citizens .
that 's trying to be that all these conversations on the field to take place , that not the <unk> interests , or the <unk> skills across the skills of citizens to stand .
the citizens were there are experts , they 're experts , for their neighborhood , you know what you missing , which <unk> they do with a place to connect , which tradition , a place , and also , you were there 's missing .


this leads to a <unk> , all the information for all available now , and the then the place emulates that can be .
by maybe even trace to be able to the an identification , the gps can allow us .
a dialogue in the gravitational field also means that 's wishes of residents and indeed taken seriously , you .
and it also then , if somebody says , i want a <unk> next to the marketplace .
this one of course , total <unk> be , but that 's trying to be , <unk> dialog with all the arrival <unk> , is the right solution , and maybe in <unk> , the <unk> accommodate , but maybe a different place .
again , that has created in dialogue is what will emerge .
second point are ways <unk> .
our <unk> 's colorful .
one feels completely comfortable , when he was <unk> large group , and you can talk .
another can do good writing , i want , but the text , and then not going <unk> large group to talk .
another of records , and another lawyer or photographing it .
or puts his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i say it has distinct <unk> to get different user groups were agreed to be .

in the background , ai small exhibition .
we have here is the possibility of them anyway , <unk> to give
we have the possibility of them anyway , to paint .
we have the possibility of them anyway , to write .
regardless of the age .
this was a <unk> girl .
and we had the way of our ideas with their faces to connect to play with ideas to <unk> .
well , the ability , outside of <unk> <unk> to participate , should do it would be .
this can take over a <unk> happen , that can think about <unk> <unk> happen .

we even have the entire process in parallel on facebook , accompanied shops and on a most independent blog and while news <unk> about a <unk> distributed .
our third point <unk> .
you may remember that i said that <unk> often too late to take place .
at my <unk> event there 's already been finished <unk> .
<unk> is the process , but then when he 's very early intervention and the <unk> , ideally , even have n't know , with <unk> area to happen to do .

<unk> heard the way too pricey for <unk> itself .
and which then , if not from the start would is that the <unk> event like , and i look up , based on the experiences from the previous scarcity .
what happens now , if you citizens in your city academics and your city <unk> .
it 's already in numerous mass of projects to see .
i did you an example from <unk> , this is the <unk> , is probably at a lot of this is known .
in which was just a project , there 's going to a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> there are capable of six weeks <unk> dollars to come together the funding to be done should do or at least <unk> .
the time has taken in august i wrote the politics , he could not different , as the idea to their own way .
but the <unk> in new york , which i made ' i wo n't tell you have , because he 's a of the key <unk> the city , so it 's not an idea of politics or managing dissent .
contrary , the <unk> , for <unk> were made a solid .
in <unk> , lest we 're going back in germany would have the citizens are already <unk> plans for <unk> a sense of them back , <unk> .
the city was then i said <unk> 's not necessary .
the four weeks <unk> that we for <unk> <unk> have to the rich very different than <unk> out .
today is the <unk> the city , offline .
during the side <unk> d e , wonderful work and the city of the <unk> that the initiative , who 's founded it and other <unk> supported .

in rotterdam , they formed a <unk> <unk> .
all well as far , you want to say .
then we do , but now , just stepping forth .
but i think it for the wrong , the city of responsibility to leave .
why ?
one , because you know , a look for everyone 's all have or should have .
during the most dedicated to be it inspires initiatives , or company itself the rule on one for them in one form the relevant , focus has the city against the responsibility for the projects that 's also the edge of attention to face .
and for any of course , the city of the projects are taking , very different tools available .
a <unk> initiative that can get just <unk> raise .
also our goal was actually a <unk> initiative , the following their way planned that was roughly half a year to work , the results and the responsibility on the city to vomit , i wanted .
<unk> a double <unk> has the villa out in january you bought .
it 's going to have negotiations .
therefore we 've not at this problem that we the responsibility , not yet , bid was happening .
but we know definitely the already now , that , if the city of a villa successful <unk> , if the negotiation that actually successful ones that then a <unk> place has become .
in the adolescent form of the brain is actually more open .
the end to come i 'm convinced that many projects that its importance of complexity or whatever their expense of the city designed to be a chance to have any satisfaction approval and identification , to create .
if you just in time , a dialog with the citizens <unk> be .
in each of the city and citizens .
in each of the city and you all that they do tonight sit here .

that it .
last night , after the <unk> we were here <unk> in <unk> and you 're going to that <unk> did .
we have <unk> talked about .
so like this idea , there ai n't second chance to have , if it in this life is not [ unclear ] has , then it 'll make it ai n't second chance .
we found quite exciting .
and we were going to stay relatively fast forward to agree that 's two things , which do n't we 'll experience of stuff .
this one is the puberty .
this second , there was also immediate run into oneness at the table , we 'll make the school ?


school , some of them to remind you might even <unk> out <unk> .
for me , it is yes , now this <unk> years ago , but the words to lead me very sensitive to <unk> hands .
my neck straps herself go together and i just at & <unk> .
and then i do n't know , how it makes them was , but my exams , then over the of this with the <unk> taken seriously as well , of sat eating the next to me .
no idea , from it 's gone .
they 're going to understand it , so , my school was really not pleasant and after i put my final <unk> behind me , she was perfectly clear , never again , school .
and what i 'm saying , when i on this year <unk> <unk> some of the most days , which i actually spent got 'em , did i in schools have spent .
with huge passion , and totally free .
how birds ' champion ?
how could this happen ?
that you know , once that something happens is , what i do n't do calculating was okay .
i got kids .
so , my wife -- i got the children .
and therefore i was actually , clearly that they <unk> is , who get this <unk> to deal with had .
and to the one day , when she said , honey , it 's <unk> .
and today , you go down .
yes , <unk> .
there i opened the door and then i sat there was basically in this <unk> , whoa , i felt i was thrown in <unk> .
that looked like them out , how it looked at us did .

and when i then the teacher , say , i stopped and you know , the ones learn not for the school , but for boys ' lives there <unk> ' i said , omg , the sentence did i 'm back to do n't <unk> .
what is that , we learn from the school , from this high school in fact , serving life actually picked them ?
so many of us have <unk> there really well , learned .
where they 're in their life <unk> have ever really well , we need to do ?
and maybe you know some yet , like the capital from yugoslavia means .
what 's another time in yugoslavia ?

well i got 'em , that time needed for the <unk> , but otherwise ?

if the empathic , is , and if the good and diagnostic of traits that ?


if we like <unk> , about <unk> years by the middle <unk> century , there may that i 'm voted it .
this is the time , the in germany , the <unk> then some point entirely introduced .
and where do like this system to fit it now it , its roots up .
and if we have the time , then imagine , then there was actually so , the people , then , who had no access to know their time .
and there were these four or six years , which they sort of forced by , the school to go and you 're crammed with some that were then we really the only way , who had to put up with the wisdom and the facts and the information in their time to connect to come .
now has a <unk> more information in his pocket and as the library of <unk> time .
and the middle <unk> century , that was the time of the industrialization .
that means there has to have changed in the world and there were suddenly people needs of these new machines have done .
while also been , but also human needs of these machines to wait , and repair our way .
and we needed to people that these machines to construct it could and the those factories <unk> .
may recognize them , it already .
this <unk> school , that we now in germany in many places have to be its root in this time .
and it 's potentially make sense .
well , because it was probably really like that , i in the school actually learned got 'em , for work at the assembly line , well , who 's a molecular assembly line standing , the stood up his entire life .
we do <unk> looking inside the future .
let 's take this <unk> century , where it is , and we 're going to look at this year <unk> on .
this year <unk> was this year , there was the first <unk> just close to pop .
i was with my studying those ready and i thought now is the point , now do you walk autonomously , the first company .
yes , after some around me up with the internet , then <unk> ' i , then <unk> ' i found that now , this is cranking out .
and some corporations are at us <unk> and they were bigger and bigger , and we are so beautiful slow grown , and some of the companies are coming up with us again , so in free-fall <unk> .
you 're always two times in life .
and we had then after a few years before that growth rates of staff .
so , we had such a growth and we had so exciting when professions are on board , like <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know , if you ai n't valued concrete have a democracy , these people do , but i went into the school was we had no idea that 's so what ever going to be .
even when i <unk> did was one of what 's like the web did n't talk .
and the kids that we now in school kids have the best job that are in 10 to fifteen to 20 or 30 years have ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and , which you know what kind of facts are going to the need to in those future jobs to doing ?
and if you 're honest , there too the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we degrees , in the future , no farther , who could tell me because the <unk> for the single saturday , sharing .
there <unk> <unk> , did i read .
well , you see , you have no idea .
how we can get started out , school for boys ' lives learning its leg ?
what are the things that we need to kids who 's life could fit in doing ?
and maybe help people like a glimpse into in this , businesses today at 12,000 employees to go .
that are going into the <unk> from school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and the universities are coming up in the company .
and if you ai classic <unk> look right now , which stands up at first is yes , what , like the expertise .
there want to the `` yes , who read itself , so , we 're looking <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and it , twelve years in offshore .
this is going to school , and also the future ca n't afford .

and that you can basically in three discrete groups to summarize .
this is one , businesses and wishes to give employees , the scalable , are , flexibility and this is a .
then you want to almost all businesses close with <unk> thinking .
and then you want to these businesses close to the <unk> are .
we have flexibility and leaders , thinking and <unk> .
we start with the flexibility in .
this is relatively quick <unk> .
if we wanted to look , how businesses today , it works , how fast you know , how fast at all change .
<unk> , yes , all models are going to the internet of today , the morning on the upside down .
there 's practice of on my collaborator , the with this change can deal .
there 's practice of on my collaborator , who are creative .
there 's practice of on my collaborator , the <unk> are .
this is quite sure that the opposite of the what the factory , the end <unk> century of collaborators at the assembly and it 's taken away .
well that second subject of this entrepreneurial potential is relatively content .
there 's go around the responsibility .
there 's going to people , who take responsibility .
first time for yourself and their own life .
but also for this big thing .
if this now , this company is -- well as a society , wishing that people who take responsibility for this big thing .
and the third factor , the <unk> , who becomes almost a major <unk> .
and if we have to the football <unk> remember , then there 's about it 's the internet for this beautiful saying .
argentina , has <unk> <unk> portugal , has <unk> and germany has a team .

that could the only in common set .
and but somebody , this big energy innovator -- our time , steve jobs <unk> .
it was not the , of that the iphone , invented has to the has not the <unk> invented , of that caused massive itunes n't invented , of it 's not been invented .
the had a team , this possible this has done , because just as a team for people who do that what they did .
so this ai at school , the these three things are playing field , that 's about it ai at school , the we take it 's lives learning .
but there are <unk> fourth of the point , and the is me almost more important .
and this is learning basic matters .
if that the only , we think about the future with safety saying we can is that she 's uncertainty is then it 's the ability to keep a new to learn and fun doing to have to learn to experiencing the <unk> do that we in <unk> life , and that our children in <unk> lives are successful .
that if only seeing it ai at school , the sort of convey .
i was ?
i sat in this <unk> and the rest of them , who have kids , who know that 's not just this ai event is , who <unk> pay forward .
so this ai event , after the motto was already all said , but not yet from each other .
and to that point , where <unk> elected to be , there will then suddenly all the invisible .
yes , i was sitting there and what can i say , the <unk> one of my kids were these <unk> even the funniest parts of the event .
so much fun , it was for me as a parent , if you kind of stress around this theme of homework and learn this whole <unk> <unk> .


just took it was also not <unk> , it was like it 's a <unk> , and immediately after the last one hour and reality , we were also the single parents who were invited me .

<unk> are , but two years , which we <unk> have , there 's how do anything not .
what do we 're wrong ?
and we had to actually the answers questioned , is our child 's broken ?
and we 're all the single , where it would go ?


and what i say it 's got me almost the same story with a his kids did he almost equal experienced as we , and that we had been fortunate that we our children there <unk> could go out of schools , yeah ?
in berlin , there 's hand , ai <unk> at different schools and we could actually , charter into account .
but can that anyone out there are doing ?
somehow was that up to do know , just our children in safety to bring and these grievances out there would be making , how they are .
and after we 're both right now the impression that had to school has just since we were there are really changed we thought , yeah well , we 're all the first , the topic that now let 's problems .
now , how shall we as <unk> there anything to change ?
this is the good that we deceive them .
we 're not alone .

it 's miserable not that just the children and their parents lying under the suffering , out there 's often happens .
if we have the teachers to look , 30 percent of teachers have <unk> .
if we wanted to look , how to the number of <unk> in the last decade has changed who has just doubled .
it can now be that all parents did what’s wrong to do ?
that all children were broken we are and that even those teachers to break are
or it be that we have a school system that , this is simply not much more fitting , like this <unk> ago <unk> years of fit just not too much more right .
and we have many people found , there are similar body down and we even people found that have kids .
and they 've understood that you take responsibility need for the future that you take responsibility need for the future , you take responsibility for this , we our children and the kids , which are now the school students going to hang on the way to give .
and we have to <unk> second point <unk> there are out there ai whole range of literacy initiatives , which change , say , and there 's <unk> schools , here and there really cool <unk> and there 's almost at school teacher , who really involved now , and something to alter ourselves .
and there are even the or another courageous principal , of yourself , <unk> the first step to go .
and how we should now as <unk> help ?
we did n't know , no concept that we 're going to help us could .
but we can one thing to do , we can in those schools and we can in these schools , people , which represents , the parents , the teachers and the students to bring and we can do with ones in two days , ai whole lot .
there are coming from people along the in the past , like it against each have worked and the learning in two days , it means that link to work .
the ground up with <unk> quite a concrete challenge of them together to solve .
and after two kind of days have the then , such a new <unk> developed , or the <unk> given for this ai n't totally new to high as we 're one of the berlin , school right now , or accompany the instructions .
or who have a concrete measures , for <unk> problems that they do in your school have to evolve .
inside of two days , together has those approaches , the next day away you do you can .
but what this <unk> is , at these two days happens , and that makes it for me , so beautiful , the small number of the weekends , which i 've got 'em , then also look at night schools across all of germany to spend , is that energy that there 's when the three things to learn .
if the three things together to experience , which is so what makes the flexibility <unk> .
so effectively become leaders , thinking and when you as a team to experience .
then that 's a spark of <unk> .
and if we are four weeks after that <unk> workshop here at ai at school , back then uses that we that comes to the school as a whole started off , to change that there ai n't totally new culture that 's .
and that 's hot .
and i <unk> ' they 'll invite one in school to think .
i <unk> ' they 'll invite men , about education was thinking .
and i <unk> ' she was mostly also to invite men , i think about the school , to talk .
you 're talking about this , you do , but you 're talking about this is also on , you do n't like .
they will be surprised , how much <unk> get yourself and how many people that same have experienced , but just not about it 's talk .
let 's just let 's just on every school in germany will <unk> century from them .
let 's just this whole system to change .
and let 's just that they want to do with the people who school every day for make up , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because just invite you can we do this .
thank you .
